# Provider adapter architecture

The AI Gateway speaks one internal request/response shape — OpenAI chat-completions — and every provider that does not speak it natively gets an **adapter** that translates in both directions. This document defines the adapter contract, the dispatch path, and the eight binding rules (§3a) every adapter must follow.

## 1. The canonical model

The gateway translates every provider into a **canonical** OpenAI shape so the router, the response cache key, hook input, the audit envelope, and request lineage never branch on provider. Canonical is defined **per endpoint kind** (`typology.EndpointKind` — `chat`, `embeddings`, `image_generation`, `tts`, `stt`, `batch`, `models`, …):

- **Chat** is the richest canonical — OpenAI chat-completions. `canonicalbridge.Bridge` converts a non-OpenAI ingress body into it (`IngressChatToCanonical`), into a target wire (`IngressChatToWire`), and back to the caller's shape on the response side (`ResponseCanonicalToIngress`, `ResponseAcrossFormats`). Anthropic, Gemini, Vertex, Bedrock, and Cohere each implement the chat canonical↔wire mapping.
- **Embeddings** has a parallel canonical — the OpenAI embeddings shape (`input`, `model`, `dimensions`, `encoding_format`) — with its own `IngressEmbeddingsToCanonical` / `IngressEmbeddingsToWire`. Gemini, Vertex, Bedrock, Cohere, and Voyage translate to it; each adapter's `embed_canonical.go` carries the mapping.
- The remaining OpenAI-shaped kinds (responses-API, audio speech / transcriptions, image generation, batches, the older `/v1/completions` text endpoint, model listing) flow as OpenAI shape. No non-OpenAI provider translates them, so cross-format routing for those kinds stays OpenAI-only.

Dispatch is keyed by two values:

- **`Format`** (`packages/ai-gateway/internal/providers/core`) — the adapter family (one Format per adapter).
- **`typology.WireShape`** (`packages/shared/transport/typology`) — which native wire a given call targets (`WireShapeOpenAIChat`, `WireShapeAnthropicMessages`, `WireShapeBedrockEmbeddings`, …). The bridge resolves the target wire per endpoint kind via `chatWireShapeForFormat` / `embeddingsWireShapeForFormat`.

The `(Format, WireShape)` projection is described in [endpoint-typology-architecture.md](../../cross-cutting/foundation/endpoint-typology-architecture.md).

## 2. The AdapterSpec contract

Every adapter under `packages/ai-gateway/internal/providers/specs/<name>/` returns an `AdapterSpec` (`packages/ai-gateway/internal/providers/core/spec.go`); the generic `specAdapter` (`packages/ai-gateway/internal/providers/dispatch/spec_adapter.go`) composes it into a runtime `Adapter`. The spec carries:

| Field | Role |
|---|---|
| `Format` | The adapter family this spec implements. |
| `Transport` | `BuildURL` / `ApplyAuth` / `Do` / `Probe` — endpoint, auth, HTTP execution, health probe. |
| `SchemaCodec` | `EncodeRequest` (canonical→wire) / `DecodeResponse` (wire→canonical). |
| `StreamDecoder` | `Open` — wraps the upstream SSE body as a `StreamSession`. |
| `ErrorNormalizer` | `Normalize` — maps an upstream error response to a canonical `ProviderError`. |
| `PassthroughRewrite` | Optional `func(payload map[string]any, modelID string) []string` — per-model rewrites on the passthrough path. |
| `RequestShapes` | The `typology.WireShape` values this adapter accepts. |

The codec-facing interfaces take `shape typology.WireShape` as the per-call dispatch parameter:

```go
type Transport interface {
    BuildURL(target CallTarget, shape typology.WireShape, stream bool) (string, error)
    ApplyAuth(r *http.Request, target CallTarget) error
    Do(ctx context.Context, r *http.Request) (*http.Response, error)
    Probe(ctx context.Context, target CallTarget) (*ProbeResult, error)
}

type SchemaCodec interface {
    EncodeRequest(shape typology.WireShape, canonicalBody []byte, target CallTarget) (EncodeResult, error)
    DecodeResponse(shape typology.WireShape, nativeBody []byte, contentType string) (DecodeResult, error)
}

type StreamDecoder interface {
    Open(r io.ReadCloser, shape typology.WireShape) (StreamSession, error)
}

type ErrorNormalizer interface {
    Normalize(status int, headers http.Header, body []byte) *ProviderError
}
```

The `shape` parameter tells the codec which of its native wire shapes the call targets — the OpenAI codec dispatches `WireShapeOpenAIChat` to chat-completions encoding, `WireShapeOpenAIResponses` to responses-API encoding, `WireShapeOpenAIEmbeddings` to embeddings encoding. A codec rejects shapes it does not implement.

## 3. The dispatch path

`specAdapter.Execute` runs `PrepareBody`, which chooses between two paths:

- **Passthrough.** When the caller's body is already in the adapter's `Format` (or both sides are OpenAI-family), `PassthroughRewrite` applies any in-place model rewrites and the body is forwarded. `stripNexusNamespace` deletes the `nexus` key from the body before it reaches the upstream, so extension metadata never leaks to the provider.
- **Codec.** Otherwise `SchemaCodec.EncodeRequest` translates the canonical body into the target wire.

`canonicalbridge.Bridge` (`packages/ai-gateway/internal/execution/canonicalbridge`) holds the per-`Format` codecs and exposes `IngressChatToCanonical`; its `chatWireShapeForFormat` / `embeddingsWireShapeForFormat` helpers resolve the native `WireShape` for a `Format`.

On an upstream error response the adapter's `ErrorNormalizer.Normalize` produces a canonical `ProviderError`, which the ingress layer reshapes to the caller's format (Rule 8).

### Ingress shape preservation (round-trip)

The caller's wire shape is preserved end-to-end: whatever ingress a client calls — `/v1/chat/completions`, `/v1/messages`, gemini `:generateContent`, `/v1/responses`, `/v1/embeddings`, plus the Azure and GLM native ingresses — receives a response in that same shape. The upstream target wire is an internal concern resolved at the call site, not the caller's:

- **Request.** The ingress body is canonicalized once (`IngressChatToCanonical` for chat-kind, `IngressEmbeddingsToCanonical` for embeddings), then `TargetExecutor` sets the call-time `WireShape` from the *target* format — `ChatWireShapeForTarget` for chat-kind, `EmbeddingsWireShapeForTarget` for embeddings — so `Transport.BuildURL` and `SchemaCodec.EncodeRequest` target the correct wire for the primary target and every failover target. The per-request `Ingress.WireShape` is not mutated to the target shape; the `/v1/responses` → chat-completions downgrade is the one exception, because Responses canonicalizes to chat before dispatch.
- **Response.** The upstream wire body is decoded to canonical, then reshaped back to the caller's format with `ResponseCanonicalToIngress` (chat) / `ResponseCanonicalToIngressEmbeddings` (embeddings), keyed on the ingress read from the request context (not the mutable per-request copy). The reshape fires when the ingress format differs from the target and is an identity no-op for same-format native routes.

The cross-format decision is driven by `typology.KindFromWireShape` (chat / embeddings) plus the responses-native rule rather than a hardcoded ingress list, so a new chat or embeddings ingress is covered without changing the dispatch gates.

## 3a. The eight binding rules

These rules are binding. Any change under `packages/ai-gateway/internal/providers/specs/<name>/` (codec, stream session, error normalizer, hub ingress) must conform before shipping. Run `/adapter-conformance-check` to audit an adapter against them.

### Rule 1 — canonical is the OpenAI shape

All internal flow — router input, cache key, hook input, audit envelope, request lineage — sees the canonical form, which is OpenAI's shape for the endpoint kind (§1). The chat canonical is OpenAI chat-completions:

```
model · messages[] · max_tokens / max_completion_tokens · temperature · top_p · top_k ·
stream · stop · response_format · tools[] · tool_choice · parallel_tool_calls ·
metadata · stream_options
```

The embeddings canonical is the OpenAI embeddings shape (`input` · `model` · `dimensions` · `encoding_format`). New canonical fields require an architecture change — adapters do not add canonical fields unilaterally.

### Rule 2 — each non-OpenAI adapter owns its full bidirectional translation

`SchemaCodec.EncodeRequest` does canonical→wire; `SchemaCodec.DecodeResponse` does wire→canonical. The OpenAI side stays the identity codec (`packages/ai-gateway/internal/providers/specs/openai`) — it never carries "this came from Anthropic so do X" branches. OpenAI shape is the bus; every other shape adapter (`specs/anthropic/codec`, `specs/gemini/codec`) wires itself onto it.

### Rule 3 — per-model wire quirks live in the adapter that talks to that wire

Parameter renames, mandatory clamping, and HTTP-400 deprecations live in the adapter that owns the wire — either in its codec prefix-lists or in its `PassthroughRewrite`. They do not live in cross-adapter switches inside `spec_adapter.go`.

| Quirk | Lives in |
|---|---|
| `claude-opus-4-7` deprecates `temperature` / `top_p` / `top_k` | `specs/anthropic/codec/codec.go` (`anthropicModelRejectsSamplingParams`) |
| `claude-4.x` rejects `temperature` + `top_p` together | `specs/anthropic/codec/codec.go` (`anthropicModelRejectsTempTopPTogether`) |
| gpt-5.x / o-series rename `max_tokens` → `max_completion_tokens` and strip sampling params | `specs/openai/rewrites` (`ApplyReasoningRewrites`, wired as the OpenAI `PassthroughRewrite`) |
| kimi-k2.5 / k2.6 require `temperature = 1` | `specs/compat/moonshot/rewrites.go` (`ApplyRewrites`, wired as the Moonshot `PassthroughRewrite`) |

When a new family ships a wire deprecation, add the rule to the adapter that owns its wire. Cross-adapter shared helpers create the wrong dependency direction.

### Rule 4 — extension fields ride in `nexus.ext.<provider>.<key>`

Fields with no clean OpenAI mapping (Anthropic's `thinking`, Gemini's `thinkingConfig`, Bedrock's `anthropic_version`) travel inside the `nexus.ext.<provider>.<key>` namespace on the canonical body. The helpers live in `packages/ai-gateway/internal/providers/canonicalext`:

- `Get` / `Set` — read and write a namespaced value.
- `ScanUnsupported` — walk top-level canonical keys against an adapter's supported set.
- `WarnOnce` — emit a one-shot WARN when an adapter observes an unsupported canonical field, so operators see drift between the canonical surface and the codec.

`stripNexusNamespace` removes the whole `nexus` key on the passthrough path before the body reaches the upstream.

### Rule 5 — cross-format callers canonicalize before the codec

A caller holding an ingress-format body (Anthropic `/v1/messages`, Gemini `:generateContent`) MUST canonicalize first:

```go
canonical, err := bridge.IngressChatToCanonical(ingress, body, target)
```

before invoking the codec. Skipping canonicalization makes the OpenAI identity codec forward the ingress body verbatim, and the upstream returns 400 (or parses partially and produces garbage). `EncodeRequest` accepts a canonical body (or a codec-empty passthrough); it does not accept arbitrary shapes.

### Rule 6 — streaming and non-streaming have parity

A codec rule that strips `temperature` from a non-streaming request must strip it from the streaming variant too — the upstream rejects both. Both paths construct their pre-dispatch body through the same `PrepareBody`, so parity normally falls out for free. For OpenAI-family streams, `applyStreamUsageOption` sets `stream_options.include_usage` so usage accounting survives the stream.

### Rule 7 — every prefix-list rule cites an observed 400

Each "model X rejects param Y" list is backed by an **observed** upstream 400, not speculation. The comment above each prefix-list switch records the upstream error message and the traffic trace it was seen on:

```go
// Observed via trace_id=<id> on claude-opus-4-7:
//   400 "<field> is not allowed for this model"
var anthropicModelRejectsSamplingParams = []string{ /* ... */ }
```

`anthropicModelRejectsSamplingParams` in `specs/anthropic/codec/codec.go` is the canonical example. Without evidence, a speculative rule silently flattens caller intent — it strips a parameter the model actually accepts and degrades behaviour with no surfaced reason.

### Rule 8 — error envelopes are reshaped to the caller's ingress format

A normalized `ProviderError` is never serialized in one hardcoded shape. `packages/ai-gateway/internal/ingress/envelope/error_envelope.go` exposes `EncodeErrorEnvelopeForIngress(ingress, upstream, pe)`, which selects the encoder for the caller's format — `encodeOpenAIErrorEnvelope`, `encodeAnthropicErrorEnvelope`, `encodeGeminiErrorEnvelope`, or `encodeResponsesAPIErrorEnvelope`. The streaming variant `encodeErrorEnvelopeForIngressForStream` wraps the JSON envelope in the SSE frame.

An Anthropic caller receives an Anthropic-shaped error even when the upstream error and its normalization were OpenAI-internal. Hand-building an OpenAI-shape error frame regardless of caller is the recurring gap this rule closes. The streaming framing details are in [sse-streaming-compliance-architecture.md](../../cross-cutting/safety/sse-streaming-compliance-architecture.md).

## 4. Request backstops & protocol defaults

A codec fills protocol-required fields the caller omitted, so an OpenAI-shaped request reaches a stricter upstream without a 400. The canonical example is Anthropic's `max_tokens`: Anthropic rejects a request that omits it, while OpenAI treats it as optional. When a caller forwards an OpenAI-shape body with neither `max_tokens` nor `max_completion_tokens`, the Anthropic codec synthesizes one from `AnthropicModelMaxOutput(model)` — the published per-model output ceiling, matched by model-name prefix, with a conservative floor for unrecognized models (`specs/anthropic/codec/codec.go`).

This is the adapter-fill pattern: the adapter that owns the wire supplies the protocol default rather than forcing the caller — or an admin config knob — to know each provider's required fields. Backstops live in the codec (Rule 3) and apply to streaming and non-streaming alike (Rule 6). Both the parameter-removal rewrites (temperature / top_p / top_k) and the synthesized `max_tokens` fill are recorded in the `rewrites` list, so the handler stamps `x-nexus-coerced` and the applied cap is observable in `traffic_event`.

## 5. Usage parsing & translation

Every codec's `DecodeResponse` returns canonical token accounting in `DecodeResult.Usage`. Extraction is centralized: `core.ExtractUsage(raw, wireFormat)` (`packages/ai-gateway/internal/providers/core/usage_extractor.go`) parses the upstream body through the shared Tier-1 normalizer for that wire format and returns the canonical `Usage`. Codecs delegate here instead of each carrying their own alias-chain logic.

Usage is normalized to the OpenAI convention so downstream cost, analytics, and audit never branch on provider:

- `PromptTokens` = uncached input + cache-read + cache-creation. The Anthropic normalizer folds its raw `input_tokens` (uncached only) and cache tokens into this total; callers must not subtract cache tokens again.
- `CompletionTokens` follows the OpenAI convention (for Gemini, candidates + thoughts).
- OpenAI-compatible wires share one normalizer that resolves the cached-token alias chain (DeepSeek `prompt_cache_hit_tokens`, Moonshot `prompt_cache_tokens`, Responses-API top-level `input_tokens` / `output_tokens`).

Cache-token detail also rides in `nexus.ext.<provider>.<key>` (Rule 4) — the Anthropic codec stores `cache_creation_input_tokens` there — and surfaces as `CacheReadTokens` / `CacheCreationTokens` on the normalized usage. The full normalize contract is in [normalization-architecture.md](normalization-architecture.md).

## 6. Prompt-cache handling

Anthropic `cache_control` is not a separate canonical field. On the passthrough path it rides inside the `messages` content; on the cache-prep path the gateway can inject cache markers before upstream dispatch. On the response side, the cache token counts the upstream reports are parsed by the usage path (§5) and preserved both on canonical usage (`CacheReadTokens` / `CacheCreationTokens`) and in `nexus.ext`. The marker mechanism, cache semantics, hit classification, and cost impact are owned by [prompt-cache-architecture.md](prompt-cache-architecture.md); an adapter's obligation is to preserve cache markers and report the cache tokens accurately.

Because cache classification depends on the usage parse, every ingress (chat, responses, messages, gemini) must exercise prompt-cache in the gateway smoke — a cross-ingress asymmetry, where one ingress reports cache tokens and another silently drops them, is the failure this guards against (§10).

## 7. Reuse across services

The provider adapter (codec) handles the gateway's outbound provider calls. The request/response **parsing** it relies on for usage and normalized text is not gateway-specific: it lives in `packages/shared/transport/normalize`, and the AI Gateway, Compliance Proxy, Agent, and Hub audit pipeline all import the same `normalize/core` + `normalize/codecs`. `core.ExtractUsage` is the gateway's entry into that shared layer.

The consequence: the same upstream response yields byte-identical canonical usage whether the gateway saw it on a forwarded call, the compliance proxy saw it on intercepted HTTPS, or the agent saw it on a client's outbound traffic. Adding a usage or text field for a provider means extending the shared normalizer once, not per service. The interception-side detail (Tier-1 traffic adapters, Tier-2 detectors) lives in the compliance-proxy architecture docs; the shared normalize contract is in [normalization-architecture.md](normalization-architecture.md).

## 8. Per-adapter walkthrough

`specs/anthropic/` is the full example of an own-wire adapter:

- `spec.go` — assembles the `AdapterSpec` (Format + Transport + SchemaCodec + StreamDecoder + ErrorNormalizer).
- `transport.go` — builds the Anthropic URL and applies the API-key + version headers.
- `codec/` — canonical↔Anthropic Messages translation, including the per-model prefix-lists and the `max_tokens` default fill.
- `stream/` — decodes the Anthropic SSE event stream into canonical chunks.
- `errors/` — maps Anthropic's `{"type":"error","error":{...}}` envelope to canonical `ProviderError` codes.
- `ingress/` — the Nexus `/v1/messages` ingress handler that turns an Anthropic-format request into canonical.

Adapters fall into three structural tiers:

| Tier | Shape | Members |
|---|---|---|
| Own wire + Nexus ingress | `codec/` `stream/` `errors/` `ingress/` subpackages | `anthropic`, `gemini` (and `openai`, the canonical/identity codec, with `codec/` `errors/` `responses/` `rewrites/` `stream/`) |
| Own wire, flat codec, no Nexus ingress | flat `codec.go` / `stream.go` / `errors.go` (+ `embed_*.go` for embeddings) | `bedrock`, `cohere`, `replicate`, `voyage` |
| Own wire, codec subpackage | `spec.go` + `transport.go` + a `codec/` subpackage (no stream/errors) | `glm` |
| Family reuse, own transport | `spec.go` + `transport.go`, borrowing the family codec | `azure` (OpenAI codec + `ApplyReasoningRewrites`), `vertex`, `minimax` |
| Family reuse, borrowed transport | `spec.go` only — reuses `openai.NewTransport()` + `openai.IdentityCodec()` | the OpenAI-compatible `specs/compat/*` adapters (`deepseek`, `fireworks`, `groq`, `huggingface`, `mistral`, `perplexity`, `together`, `xai`); `moonshot` adds `rewrites.go` for its fixed-temperature quirk |

A family-reuse adapter exists because the provider speaks an existing wire and only differs in endpoint and auth — it either supplies its own `Transport` (and borrows the family codec) or reuses the family transport outright, rather than writing a codec of its own.

## 9. Adding a new adapter

Use the `add-provider-adapter` skill for the full procedure. The wiring touch points:

1. Define the `AdapterSpec` (Format + Transport + SchemaCodec + StreamDecoder + ErrorNormalizer; add `PassthroughRewrite` only if the adapter is OpenAI-family and needs per-model rewrites).
2. Map the new `Format` in `chatWireShapeForFormat` / `embeddingsWireShapeForFormat`, or accept the OpenAI-family default for OpenAI-shape-compatible providers.
3. Add a `typology.WireShape` constant if the adapter speaks a non-OpenAI wire.
4. Add the ingress rule to `packages/shared/transport/typology/defaults.go` if a Nexus ingress path delivers requests in that wire shape.
5. Populate `RequestShapes` only with shapes backed by a captured 200 from the real upstream endpoint.

Run `/adapter-conformance-check` before completion to verify the adapter against Rules 1-8.

## 10. Testing an adapter

A new or changed adapter is validated at four levels:

- **Unit tests** — table-driven codec tests for `EncodeRequest` / `DecodeResponse`: canonical↔wire round-trips, each prefix-list rule, the backstop fill (§4), and usage extraction (§5). Each Go package holds ≥95% statement coverage.
- **Conformance** — `/adapter-conformance-check` audits the codec against §3a Rules 1-8 (per-adapter logic that leaked into the dispatcher, missing canonicalize-before-encode, error envelopes that bypass the helper, prefix-lists without observed-400 evidence, missing `PassthroughRewrite` wiring).
- **Full-surface smoke** — `tests/scripts/smoke-gateway.py --all-ingress` exercises every model across all ingresses (chat / responses / messages / gemini), non-stream + SSE + a two-turn cache arm. It cross-checks each `traffic_event` row (cost, tokens, cache classification, normalized text) and diffs Prometheus counters. The prompt-cache arm is mandatory on every ingress (§6).
- **Usage / cost cross-check** — the smoke compares the parsed canonical usage against the persisted `traffic_event` row, catching a codec that parses usage but fails to stamp it.

Any change under `packages/ai-gateway/internal/providers/specs/<name>/` requires a gateway smoke run before the work is considered done.
