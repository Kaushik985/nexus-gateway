# Adversarial Security Audit — Program Tracker

> **Status:** PHASES 0–5 COMPLETE + **G6 verify round COMPLETE (2026-06-10)**. **41 confirmed** (2 CRIT, 17 HIGH, 14 MED, 8 LOW) + 19 kill-chains + threat-model + ranked roadmap; **41/41 findings have a landed fix** (35 CLOSED, 3 MORPHED with residuals fixed or risk-accepted, SEC-W3-01 re-fixed under G6, 2 platform-pending). Remaining: 2 platform-pending on-host verifications (SEC-M4-02 keystore, SEC-M8-02 NE watchdog, plus SEC-M8-01's live UDP test) — maintainer-owned via `Skill('build-agent')`. Layer A/C SHIPPED; Layer B CANCELLED (risk-accepted). Next: the closing arch+product two-round review, then program close.
> **Worktree:** `.claude/worktrees/security-audit` / branch `worktree-security-audit`

> **Resume note (2026-06-08):** arch-audit's read-only audit (Phases 1–7) is COMPLETE and its fix
> program has merged the S2 batches into `worktree-arch-audit` (through `4fb126066`). That branch was
> merged into this one (merge commit `77e86466f`), so the security audit now runs against **settled
> code** — satisfying the "security trails arch" coordination trigger. The arch-audit ledger lives
> in-tree at **`audit/`** (`PROGRAM.md` / `LEDGER.md` / `SYNTHESIS.md` / `chains/`); its final tally
> was 2 S1 (both fixed), 43 S2, 111 S3, 71 S4, ~30 V. Security-relevant arch findings already fixed
> include F-0044 (unauth ai-guard webhook), F-0060 (Hub device-token cross-Thing binding), F-0200
> (enrollment thingId takeover), F-0190 (SIEM log injection), F-0284 (admin tokens → httpOnly cookies),
> F-0269 (simulator SSRF). The security pass **confirms rather than re-finds** these and hunts what an
> arch-correctness lens does not: malicious paths, boundary conditions, broken trust assumptions.

## Goal

> **Goal:** Audit Nexus Gateway from a *real attacker's* perspective — not "is the architecture sound" but "where does a sound-looking architecture fail against malicious paths, boundary conditions, and broken trust assumptions." Organized **module → chain → whole-system**, with every finding adversarially verified and given attacker-PoC reasoning. Multi-phase, multi-session.

The prior architecture review concluded "the design is fine." This program deliberately takes the opposite stance: assume every trust boundary is hostile and try to break it.

## Scope correction (binding for this program)

- **No "tenant" concept exists.** The isolation unit is the **virtual key (VK)**. All "isolation" findings are framed as **cross-VK** isolation, never "cross-tenant."

## Threat actors (attacker personas)

| ID | Persona | Entry point |
|----|---------|-------------|
| A1 | External unauthenticated network attacker | AI Gateway `:3050`, Compliance Proxy `:3128`, CP `:3001` login, Hub `:3060` WS |
| A2 | Malicious holder of a *valid* virtual key | AI Gateway request path (cross-VK isolation, cache, quota, credential extraction) |
| A3 | Compromised / rogue Agent node | Hub enrollment, WS shadow channel, config/kill-switch push |
| A4 | Compromised upstream provider / on-path MITM | Gateway↔provider TLS bump, cert validation |
| A5 | Low-privilege insider admin | CP admin API, IAM tiers, 403 drift |
| A6 | Attacker with read access to a host / repo / logs | Secrets sprawl, key extraction, CA private key at rest |

## Trust boundaries (where we attack)

| ID | Boundary | Crown-jewel asset behind it |
|----|----------|------------------------------|
| TB1 | Internet ↔ Gateway/Proxy/CP/Hub | First auth decision |
| TB2 | VK ↔ VK | Per-VK data, cache, quota isolation |
| TB3 | Node ↔ Hub | Thing/shadow integrity, config authority |
| TB4 | Gateway ↔ Provider | Upstream TLS, real provider API keys |
| TB5 | Admin ↔ Admin | IAM action tiers |
| TB6 | Ciphertext ↔ Plaintext | **MITM CA private key** + **credential encryption key** |

## Crown-jewel asset inventory (blast-radius ranked)

1. **MITM CA private key** — `packages/compliance-proxy/internal/tls/issuer/issuer.go`, `packages/nexus-hub/internal/identity/agentca/ca.go`. Can sign trusted certs for *any* domain on every enrolled machine. Single largest blast radius.
2. **Credential encryption key/passphrase/salt** — `CREDENTIAL_ENCRYPTION_KEY` / `CREDENTIAL_ENCRYPTION_PASSPHRASE` / `CREDENTIAL_ENCRYPTION_SALT` / `CREDENTIAL_KEY_MAP`. Implementation: `packages/control-plane/internal/platform/crypto/aes_gcm.go`, `packages/ai-gateway/internal/credentials/decrypt/decrypt.go`. Decrypts every upstream provider API key.
3. **Internal-service token** — `INTERNAL_SERVICE_TOKEN`, `ADMIN_KEY_HMAC_SECRET`, `AI_GATEWAY_API_TOKEN`, `COMPLIANCE_PROXY_API_TOKEN`. Inter-service trust; drift = cross-service 403 or auth bypass.
4. **Virtual keys** — `packages/ai-gateway/internal/auth/vkauth/`. The thing A2 holds and the thing A1 wants to forge.
5. **Agent enrollment / identity** — `packages/nexus-hub/internal/identity/{handler/enroll,store/enrollstore,agentca}`, `packages/agent/internal/identity/`. Bootstraps node trust.

## Methodology

Each phase runs as a **deep multi-agent workflow** (fan-out finders by surface → adversarially verify every finding with N independent skeptics → only confirmed findings survive). The user opted into multi-agent scanning. I review results between phases and stay in the loop; phases are not auto-chained.

Finding severity: `CRITICAL` (crown-jewel compromise / auth bypass / cross-VK breach) > `HIGH` (privilege escalation / secret leak / DoS of safety-critical path) > `MEDIUM` (info leak / hardening gap) > `LOW` (defense-in-depth).

Every finding must carry: attacker persona, preconditions, attack steps (PoC reasoning), affected file:line, severity, and a remediation note. Findings that survive adversarial verification land in `docs/developers/security/findings/`.

## Concurrency with the arch-audit program (binding for this program)

A **second, structurally identical** program runs in parallel: the **pre-sale arch audit** — also 3-level (module / chain / whole-repo), **85+ tasks**, and it **changes code**. Its charter + ledger live at `~/workspaces/workspace-nexus/audit-2026-06/` (outside this repo; **will be moved into a worktree**). This security program and the arch program cover the same codebase from two angles: arch = correctness/structure (mutates code), security = adversarial (read-only findings).

**Decided coordination model — security trails arch, audits settled code:**

1. **Do not audit pre-refactor code.** At 85+ code-changing tasks, arch-audit will rewrite/delete most crown-jewel code. Auditing the old version = finding holes in code about to be deleted = wasted. **The security audit's main body runs AFTER arch-audit settles a unit** (per-unit) or after arch-audit completes — so it always audits final code. This is why this program is intentionally **paused** at scaffolding (see Status).
2. **Findings are invariant-anchored, not line-anchored.** Every finding records: attacker persona + violated **invariant** + a **repeatable re-check probe** (grep / probe script / test). `file:line@SHA` is only a pointer. Survives refactoring; re-locatable mechanically.
3. **Mandatory re-validation gate.** Before any fix, and after every arch-audit merge that touched audited code, re-run all probes against current `HEAD`. Each finding → `still-present` (fix) / `fixed-by-refactor` (close) / `morphed` (re-locate). This is the single hard sync point between the two programs.
4. **Feed-forward critical invariants.** Before arch-audit touches a crown jewel (CA, credential crypto, vkauth, IAM, enrollment), security hands it the security **invariants as acceptance criteria** so the rewrite is born secure; the later security pass confirms rather than re-finds.
5. **Shared decomposition.** Map this program's M1–M9 / C1–C6 / W1–W4 onto arch-audit's 85+ task units 1:1, and coordinate via a shared ledger (location TBD once arch-audit's charter moves into its worktree). A unit is **DONE** only when `arch-clean ∧ security-clean`.

**Base commit (pin):** `77e86466f` (merge of `origin/worktree-arch-audit` into `worktree-security-audit`, 2026-06-08). This is the settled, post-arch-audit code the security audit now runs against. (Original scaffold pin was `8abd8c6e0`.) Findings reference this SHA via `file:line@SHA` pointers; re-validate probes against current `HEAD` before any fix.

**Arch-audit ledger alignment:** arch-audit's units live in-tree at `audit/` (`PROGRAM.md` task board, `LEDGER.md` per-finding detail, `SYNTHESIS.md` §6 ordering, `chains/C1..C9.md` seam maps). The M1–M9 / C1–C6 / W1–W4 ↔ arch-unit 1:1 mapping is recorded per-finding as each Phase-1 module workflow runs (a finding that confirms or re-locates an arch F-ID cites it). A unit is DONE only when `arch-clean ∧ security-clean`.

## Phase plan (multi-level)

### Phase 0 — Scaffolding & attack-surface map *(this session)*
Establish this tracker, personas, boundaries, crown-jewel inventory. Enumerate every listening port, auth-bearing entry point, and the exact files behind each crown jewel. **Deliverable:** this doc + `findings/00-attack-surface-map.md`.

### Phase 1 — Module-level audit (Level 1: each crown jewel in isolation)
| Mod | Target | Primary attacker |
|-----|--------|------------------|
| M1 | Compliance Proxy CA issuer + Hub agentca (key gen entropy, at-rest protection, who-can-read, issuance constraints, name constraints, serial/validity) | A4, A6 |
| M2 | Credential crypto (nonce gen/reuse, KDF from passphrase+salt, AAD, key-map rotation, error oracle, plaintext lifetime, log leakage) | A2, A6 |
| M3 | VK auth (format, lookup, constant-time compare, at-rest hashing, revocation, scope binding, cross-VK enforcement) | A1, A2 |
| M4 | Node enrollment + attestation signer (token issuance/replay, CSR validation, identity binding) | A3 |
| M5 | Hub WS server + Thing auth (conn auth, per-message auth, can node A write node B's shadow, config/kill-switch authZ) | A3 |
| M6 | IAM catalog + middleware (action coverage vs UI `allowedActions`, 403 drift — run iam-impact-review per endpoint surface) | A5 |
| M7 | OAuth/PKCE authserver (PKCE enforcement, redirect_uri validation, token issuance/refresh, anon-login info leaks beyond known SSO-enum fix) | A1, A5 |
| M8 | NE transparent proxy fail-open (re-audit vs the 5 safety rules; bypass-compliance AND brick-the-host angles) | A2, A3 |
| M9 | Secrets management (env-vs-yaml leak, secrets in logs, MUST-MATCH drift, default/dev keys shipped) | A6 |

### Phase 2 — Chain / link audit (Level 2: trust boundaries & end-to-end flows)
| Chn | Flow | Question |
|-----|------|----------|
| C1 | Credential lifecycle: CP encrypt → DB → Hub shadow → WS push → AI Gateway decrypt → provider | Where does plaintext live; can it leak between stages |
| C2 | Enrollment & identity: node boot → enroll → cert → Hub trust → ongoing auth | Can A3 forge/replay any link |
| C3 | Config push: Admin → CP → Hub shadow → WS → node apply | Can a malicious actor inject config / kill-switch / allowlist to another node |
| C4 | Cache key derivation & isolation: request → cache key → response cache | Cross-VK leakage / cache poisoning |
| C5 | Audit/traffic event: request → traffic_event → audit | Can attacker forge/suppress audit, log injection |
| C6 | Quota / rate-limit: request → counter → enforce | Bypass, race, counter manipulation |

### Phase 3 — Whole-system / kill-chain (Level 3: cross-cutting & combined)
- W1 — Attacker kill-chains: chain Level-1/2 findings into end-to-end compromise per persona.
- W2 — Blast-radius & SPOF (CA key, master key, internal-service token).
- W3 — Fail-open/fail-closed safety review system-wide.
- W4 — Supply chain (`go.work` replace directives, build, deps).

### Phase 4 — Synthesis & remediation roadmap
Consolidated attacker-perspective threat model, ranked findings, remediation backlog, "must-fix-before-GA" gate.

### Phase 5 — Fix program (added 2026-06-08 per session goal)
After the audit (Phases 0–4) lands, **fix everything**, ordered by the Phase-4 roadmap. Policy:
- **HIGH + MEDIUM: mandatory fix.** Each follows the SEC-M2-01 standard — plan → real implementation
  (no stubs) → tests asserting the closed invariant → doc/openapi lockstep → re-run the finding's
  re-check probe to confirm `fixed` → commit per finding/cluster.
- **LOW: always recorded**; fix the simple ones (cheap, low-blast, no design decision). Defer only
  LOW that need a design call, and record the deferral reason.
- **Design-heavy fixes** (e.g. the M6 IAM permission-boundary cluster) get a brainstorm to pick the
  best product+architecture approach before coding.
- Re-validation gate: before each fix, re-run its probe against current `HEAD` (`still-present` /
  `fixed-by-refactor` / `morphed`). Auto-commit enabled.

## Status

> **PROGRAM COMPLETE except the closing review (2026-06-10)** — Phases 0–5 done; the G6 verify round (independent re-verification of all 41 shipped fixes) is COMPLETE. **41/41 findings have a landed fix**; the only outstanding items are the 2 platform-pending on-host verifications (SEC-M4-02, SEC-M8-02, plus SEC-M8-01's live UDP test), maintainer-owned via `Skill('build-agent')`. Layer A/C SHIPPED; Layer B CANCELLED (risk-accepted by user decision). Next: the mandatory closing arch+product two-round review, then program close. Per-finding verdicts: [`findings/LEDGER.md`](findings/LEDGER.md); closeout brief: `docs/handoffs/security-audit-g6-closeout.md`.

| 5 | **DONE** (2026-06-10, incl. G6 verify round) | per-cluster commits + [`findings/LEDGER.md`](findings/LEDGER.md) G6 verdicts | **41/41 landed fixes** — 35 CLOSED (G6-verified with real regression tests); 2 platform-pending (M4-02 keystore, M8-02 NE watchdog — on-host build+test maintainer-owned); 3 MORPHED with residuals fixed (M1-01 pathlen recipes+warning `ab1dd6403`; C3-01 resync signing `ab1dd6403`) or risk-accepted (W2-02 — Layer B cancelled); W3-01 reopened by G6 → re-fixed (`03de276d1` + `dcced4d2c`); Layer A review fixes landed (`2a2b11c3a`); M8-01's NE-Swift half implemented (`14a98c6a2`, on-host test pending) |

> **FIX-5 gate RESOLVED — the user signed off and FIX-5/A+B+C all SHIPPED 2026-06-09 (historical gate rationale kept below for context).** SEC-W2-01 (`ADMIN_KEY_HMAC_SECRET` purpose-split), SEC-W2-02 (`INTERNAL_SERVICE_TOKEN` per-service), SEC-W2-03 (credential master-key HKDF class-separation + KDF + AAD + KEK/DEK + leak-response runbook + deferred KMS), and SEC-C1-02 (credential-ciphertext AES-GCM AAD identity-binding) are all **cross-service `[MUST MATCH]` secret/crypto CONTRACT changes** requiring coordinated **re-keying / re-provisioning** across CP + ai-gateway + Hub (+ compliance-proxy) and (for C1-02) app-side credential-id generation. A botched change breaks **all** credential decryption (crown-jewel asset #2 → data-plane outage). Per the binding *big-changes-discuss-first* + *high-blast-radius (credential encryption)* rules, these are **not** auto-committed; the brainstormed remediation design is recorded in `/tmp/sec-ledger.json` (gate_note) and the per-finding docs. Recommend executing as one coordinated, reviewed PR after sign-off. The fix program continues autonomously on the remaining non-gated HIGH/MED (C1-01, C5-01, M5-01, C4-01, W3-01, W4-01/02).
