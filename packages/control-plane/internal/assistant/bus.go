// bus.go is the command/data-stream split. Previously a single
// POST both started a turn AND was the SSE stream, so a dropped connection killed the
// turn and there was no reconnect. The bus detaches the two:
//   - POST /sessions/:id/chat starts a turn in a BACKGROUND goroutine (it outlives the
//     POST request) and returns immediately.
//   - GET  /sessions/:id/stream is a long-lived SSE channel that attaches to the turn's
//     event bus and can reconnect with ?lastSeq= to replay missed committed events.
//   - POST /sessions/:id/interrupt cancels the running turn (the Stop button).
//
// The bus is in-memory, per-pod (Redis has no pub/sub in this system). Cross-pod
// continuity is provided by the owner registry + LB session affinity (the GET stream
// and the POST land on the owning pod), NOT a shared bus.

	// than the window gets the gap signalled (see Attach).

	// liveChanBuffer is the live-delivery channel depth. Generous so a momentarily
	// slow client never overflows mid-turn; on the rare overflow the subscriber is

// maxConcurrentTurnsPerUser caps how many of a user's sessions can have a turn in

// this cap a single user could open N distinct sessionIDs, fire N concurrent turns, and
// drain the shared system-VK budget — denying the assistant to every other user. Each
// turn can run up to StepCap tool rounds × tokens/step, so even a handful of concurrent
// turns is a meaningful share of the budget; 5 is generous for legitimate parallel use
// (a couple of chats open at once) yet tight enough that one user cannot monopolise the
// key. The concurrent-turn cap is the FIRST per-user spend gate: it bounds the MAXIMUM
// instantaneous per-user spend (≤ 5 × per-turn ceiling). A persistent per-user token/
// cost budget is a heavier, telemetry-backed second gate that can layer on top later;
// this cap stands on its own and requires no spend-tracking pipeline.
// A const, not a cfg knob: there is no demonstrated need for per-deployment divergence,
