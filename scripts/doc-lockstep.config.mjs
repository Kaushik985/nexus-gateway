//
// Maps code globs → required docs. When a PR touches any code matched by an
// entry's `code` globs, the PR diff must ALSO include at least one of the
// entry's `docs` files (a doc update). Enforced by scripts/check-doc-lockstep.mjs.
//
// Patterns are minimatch-style. Use `**` for recursive.
//
// Each entry can declare multiple `docs` — the checker accepts the diff as
// long as AT LEAST ONE of them is touched. This matches the reality that a
// single code change frequently has one canonical doc but may also need
// runbook / feature-doc / OpenAPI updates depending on the nature of the
// change. List all of them and let the engineer pick which apply.
//
// Add new entries here when you ship a new architecture / feature doc.
