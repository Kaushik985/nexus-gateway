# Control Plane UI — Infrastructure: operations and diagnostics

This group of INFRASTRUCTURE leaves is where an operator reaches for emergency control, fleet diagnostics, and Agent rollout. It covers **Kill Switch**, **Recent Errors**, **Crash Reports**, **Agent Diag Mode**, **Proxy Rollout**, and **Agent Setup**. Sidebar labels and routes are defined in `packages/control-plane-ui/src/routes/shellRouteConfig.tsx` and `packages/control-plane-ui/src/i18n/locales/en/nav.json`.

## Kill Switch

**Purpose.** A fleet-wide emergency stop that halts TLS interception across every Compliance Proxy and Agent at once.

**What you see.** A toggle control with an engaged / normal-operation badge; a per-type status breakdown — Compliance Proxies (N of M active), Agents (N of M active), and who last changed it, when, and the reason; and a merged history table of every kill-switch toggle (timestamp, node type, action, actor, version).

**Controls.** A single engage/disengage button behind a confirmation dialog. The fleet reads engaged when any Compliance Proxy or Agent has it engaged, so the badge never understates an in-flight emergency.

**Key concepts.** Engaged means a node's applied kill-switch configuration is on — it has stopped TLS interception and is passing traffic through uninspected. The toggle fans out to both compliance-proxy and Agent configuration in one call, and is meant for emergencies: a bad provider rollout, a hook regression blocking legitimate traffic, or a proxy or Agent fault.

**Where the data comes from.** The toggle is `complianceApi.setKillSwitch` → `POST /api/admin/compliance/killswitch`, gated on `kill-switch.toggle`, which stamps a dedicated kill-switch audit event. The per-type status is derived from the nodes list (`node.read`) and the toggle history from the configuration change history (`settings.read`).

## Recent Errors

**Purpose.** A triage view of the diagnostic events emitted across the fleet, grouped so an operator can spot and quiet noisy or newly appeared issues quickly.

**What you see.** A hero strip of four tiles — errors in the last hour with a trend against the hour before, the active-issue count, the top offender source with its share, and the newest issue — above an aggregate sparkline. Below it, an issue list with one row per distinct message group: a severity badge, source, affected-node count, total occurrences, first and last seen, an inline sparkline, a "new" badge for issues first seen within the hour, and a faded style for silenced rows. A filter panel — collapsed by default — covers time range, node type, event type, a show-silenced toggle, and search.

**Controls.** Per issue: view details, silence (1 hour, 24 hours, or permanent), unsilence, and — for an Agent issue — enable diagnostic mode on that node. A detail dialog shows the full event metadata and recent occurrences; a "manage silences" popup lists the active silences and lifts them.

**Key concepts.** Severity is `fatal`, `error`, `warn`, or `info`; `fatal` and `error` are the high-severity levels the active-issue count and hero tiles track. A silence is keyed on the message and level and collapses that group's silenced flag. Time ranges are 1 hour, 24 hours, 7 days, and 30 days.

**Where the data comes from.** `diagEventsApi` (groups, list) and `diagSilencesApi` (list, create, remove) — reads gated on `observability.read`, and creating or lifting a silence on `observability.write`. Enabling diagnostic mode from a detail dialog is `diagModeApi.enable`, gated on `diagnostic-mode.update`.

## Crash Reports

**Purpose.** Group Agent crashes into version × OS cohorts so a regression that only hits one build or one platform stands out from the noise.

**What you see.** A time-range filter (24 hours, 7 days, 30 days) over a cohort table: agent version, OS, OS version, crash count, affected nodes, first seen, last seen. Expanding a cohort lists its individual crash events; clicking an event opens a dialog with the message, the stack trace, and the event attributes.

**Where the data comes from.** `diagEventsApi.crashCohorts` for the cohort table and `diagEventsApi.list` (restricted to the fatal level) for the per-cohort drilldown, both gated on `observability.read`.

## Agent Diag Mode

**Purpose.** Turn on verbose Agent diagnostics for a bounded window — in bulk — to capture detail while reproducing an issue, then have it switch itself off when the window expires.

**What you see.** An active-windows table of the Agents currently in diagnostic mode (node, started, time remaining, who set it, reason), refreshing every 10 seconds, each row with a disable action behind a confirm. Below it, a bulk-enable form.

**Controls.** The bulk form filters by agent version, OS, or an explicit list of node ids — an id list overrides the other filters — with a window preset (1, 4, 12, or 24 hours; capped at 24) and a required reason. A "resolve preview" step shows the exact match count before you commit, capped at 500 agents. The outcome is reported per agent, with partial-success and all-failed panels that list the agents that did not take.

**Where the data comes from.** `diagModeApi` — the active-windows list gated on `diagnostic-mode.read`, and enable, disable, and bulk-enable on `diagnostic-mode.update`. The preview resolves the candidate agents from the nodes list (`node.read`) and applies the filter client-side.

## Proxy Rollout

**Purpose.** A launcher for rolling the Compliance Proxy out to a node — it lists the Compliance Proxy nodes and sends you into a node's setup flow.

**What you see.** One card per Compliance Proxy node with its name and status. A "configure setup" button — disabled while the node is offline — opens that node's setup flow: the four-step CA certificate / MDM profile / PAC file / onboarding helper described in the [nodes and configuration document](infrastructure-nodes.md).

**Where the data comes from.** `hubApi.listNodes` filtered to the compliance-proxy type (`node.read`).

## Agent Setup

**Purpose.** The self-service install / enroll / verify guide for putting the Agent on a workstation or server, with a troubleshooting FAQ.

**What you see.** A platform-tabbed install card (macOS, Windows, Linux) with four steps — download, install, enroll, verify — and a troubleshooting card with a searchable, category-filtered FAQ.

**Controls.** Download offers a per-platform build: a signed macOS `.pkg`, a Windows MSI that registers the Agent service and traffic-capture driver and sets the system CA-trust environment variables, or a Linux binary. Enroll is single sign-on — a headless server runs `nexus-agent enroll-sso`, which prints a URL to open on a workstation. The verify step shows a live panel of the devices bound to the current admin, refreshing every five seconds, with an online / waiting / offline badge per device. The FAQ filters by search text and six categories: trust, coverage, network, performance, logs, and lifecycle.

**Where the data comes from.** The download host comes from the Control Plane's published URL (`serviceUrlsApi.publicURLs`, `settings.read`); the verify panel reads the caller's own devices (`devicesApi.listMine`, scoped to the signed-in user); the installers are served as static downloads.
