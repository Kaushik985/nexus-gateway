# Conventions

This is the code-level style reference. It complements the hard bindings in
`CLAUDE.md` and the always-on rules under `.cursor/rules/` — sections marked
**binding** are CI-enforced, the rest are idioms the codebase follows. The Go
conventions here are the developer-facing form of `.cursor/rules/go-conventions.mdc`.

## Go

**Workspace and module paths.** All modules are linked through `go.work` at the
repo root. The module path is
`github.com/AlphaBitCore/nexus-gateway/packages/<module>`, and imports use the
full module path — Go has no relative imports.

**Naming.** Packages are lowercase, short, and underscore-free
(`configtypes`, `configcache`). Avoid stutter — `hooks.Hook`, not
`hooks.HooksRegistry`. Exported types are `PascalCase`.

**Errors.** Return errors; do not panic in library code. Sentinels are
`errors.New("specific lowercase message")`; wrap with
`fmt.Errorf("context: %w", err)`.

**Concurrency.** Use `sync.Mutex` / `sync.RWMutex` for shared state,
`atomic.Pointer` for hot-swappable config snapshots, and `sync.Pool` for
high-frequency allocations. A `context.Context` is the first parameter of any
cross-package method.

**Logging (binding).** A `*slog.Logger` is passed as a constructor parameter,
never a global. After wiring `SlogSink` and `slog.SetDefault(...)`, the
module-scope `logger` must be reassigned to `slog.Default()` — otherwise
DI-injected loggers silently bypass the diagnostics pipeline.

**Metrics.** Register through `promauto` (`prometheus/client_golang`).
Constructors that register metrics take a `namespace string` parameter.

**Testing.** Run `go test -race -count=1`, table-driven where it fits, in the
same package (white-box) or a `_test` package (black-box).

**Linting.** `golangci-lint` runs against the root `.golangci.yml`, which enables
`errorlint`, `bodyclose`, `noctx`, `copyloopvar`, and `intrange` among others.

**`replace` sibling contract (binding).** Every `packages/<svc>/go.mod` that
requires a sibling module must pin the require to exactly `v0.0.0` (an inert
placeholder, never a real pseudo-version) and carry a matching
`replace … => ../<sibling>` directive, with its `go.sum` free of any
`packages/` lines. Under Go 1.25 a real pseudo-version is validated against the
upstream remote even with `go.work` active, so without this a `GOWORK=off` build
silently pulls a stale GitHub snapshot instead of local code.
`scripts/check-workspace-replace.mjs` (pre-commit and `check:all`) blocks the
regression. `replace` is sibling-only — never fork a third-party dependency
through it.

**Forbidden.** No `sqlc` — write SQL by hand, and keep the Go struct types as
hand-maintained mirrors of the Prisma schema (there is no codegen step). No
breaking API change in `packages/shared/*` once it has shipped in a released Agent
binary; that surface is additive-only. New dependencies in `packages/shared`
outside the vetted set need explicit approval (see
[shared-packages-architecture.md](../architecture/cross-cutting/shared/shared-packages-architecture.md)).

## TypeScript and the Control Plane UI

Each of these is enforced by a guard in `check:all`:

- **i18n mandatory (binding).** Every user-visible string goes through `t()`, and
  the `en` / `es` / `zh` locale files stay at parity across both bundles
  (`scripts/check-i18n-parity.mjs`).
- **Design tokens strict (binding).** No hex or raw numeric values in
  `*.module.css` or inline `style={{}}` blocks — CSS variables only
  (`scripts/check-design-tokens.mjs`).
- **`useApi` query keys (binding).** Every query key starts with a domain prefix
  and a resource: `['admin' | 'my' | 'user' | 'proxy', '<resource>', '<variant?>',
  …stateVars]` (`scripts/check-useapi-querykey.mjs`).
- **`ui-shared` boundary (binding).** `packages/ui-shared` is a dependency leaf and
  must never import from a consumer bundle
  (`scripts/check-ui-shared-boundary.mjs`); see
  [ui-shell-architecture.md](../architecture/cross-cutting/ui/ui-shell-architecture.md).

## Cross-cutting bindings

- **English only.** Committed artifacts — docs, source comments, UI copy, config
  strings, and commit messages — are English (`.cursor/rules/english-only.mdc`).
- **IoT terminology boundary (binding).** Internal code uses the IoT vocabulary
  (Thing / Shadow / desired / reported / drift); user-facing surfaces use the
  product vocabulary (node / config sync / target config / applied config / out of
  sync). `scripts/check-terminology.sh` enforces the split.
- **Secrets are env-only (binding).** No secret field appears in committed YAML;
  cross-service shared secrets are tagged `[MUST MATCH]`
  (`scripts/check-no-yaml-secrets.mjs`); see
  [local-dev-debugging.md](local-dev-debugging.md).
- **Redis is cache-only (binding).** No Redis pub/sub — config invalidation flows
  through the Hub WebSocket (`scripts/check-no-redis-pubsub.mjs`).

## Commit style

Commits follow conventional-commits: `<type>(<scope>): <summary>`, with types such
as `docs`, `chore`, `fix`, and `feat`. Agent-authored commits carry a
`Co-Authored-By` trailer. Documentation commits land one doc per commit so review
and revert stay surgical.

## PR review checklist

Before a change is "done", run the two-round self-audit (four questions, twice,
until two consecutive rounds are clean):

1. Every todo is completed — not deferred or silently dropped.
2. No `TODO` / `FIXME` / `stub` / `unimplemented` markers in production code (test
   doubles are fine).
3. Every changed code path is exercised by a real test, or explicitly acknowledged
   as untested with a reason.
4. No "we'll fix this later" claims unless the user agreed to them.

Then the verify gate: the workspace tests are green, the plan was approved, every
doc mapped to the changed code is updated in the same change, new content is
English, and the commit reminder was raised.

## Tooling

| Area | Tool |
|------|------|
| Go build / modules | `go.work` workspace, full-module-path imports |
| Go lint | `golangci-lint` against the root `.golangci.yml` |
| Database | Prisma migrations (`tools/db-migrate`); Go struct types hand-maintained as Prisma-schema mirrors; hand-written `pgx` at runtime |
| UI unit tests | Vitest |
| UI E2E | Playwright (`tests/e2e-ui`) |
| JS monorepo | npm workspaces |
| Style / lockstep gates | the `check:*` scripts aggregated by `npm run check:all` |

`check:all` runs the design-token, i18n, theme-completeness, brand-string,
effect-token, timezone, terminology, JSON-dup-key, arch-doc-trigger,
e2e-coverage-matrix, doc-lockstep, migration-timestamp, `useApi` query-key,
no-Redis-pubsub, `ui-shared`-boundary,
sidebar-icon-mapping, workspace-replace, jobs-catalogue, no-prod-TODO,
no-yaml-secrets, and coverage guards.
