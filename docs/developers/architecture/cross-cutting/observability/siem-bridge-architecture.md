# SIEM bridge architecture

The SIEM bridge forwards a copy of every security- and audit-relevant event to a
customer-owned external SIEM (Splunk, Datadog, Elastic, or any HTTP webhook). It
lets a customer retain and correlate Nexus Gateway activity inside their own
security tooling without granting access to the Nexus database.

The bridge is a **Hub-side polling forwarder**. It does not sit in the request
path and is not driven by the message queue. It polls two PostgreSQL tables on a
schedule, classifies the new rows, and POSTs them to the configured endpoint.

## What this doc covers (and what it does not)

This doc covers the bridge itself: the poll loop, checkpointing, classification,
the sink and wire formats, the scheduler job, and the Control Plane admin surface
that configures it.

It does **not** cover how `traffic_event` and `AdminAuditLog` rows are produced —
that is the audit pipeline, described in
[audit-pipeline-architecture.md](audit-pipeline-architecture.md). The bridge is a
pure consumer of those two tables. For where the SIEM surface sits among the other
observability surfaces, see
[observability-architecture.md](observability-architecture.md).

## 1. Inputs: two tables, one forwarder

The bridge reads from exactly two tables:

- `traffic_event` — the unified traffic audit table. Every traffic source lands
  here, including compliance-proxy traffic (rows with `source = 'compliance-proxy'`).
  There is no per-service split; the bridge forwards them all through one path.
- `AdminAuditLog` — administrative mutations (who changed what, with before/after
  state).

Because the bridge consumes the already-persisted tables, an event reaches the
SIEM regardless of which service produced it, and the bridge needs no awareness of
the producers.

## 2. The poll loop

`packages/nexus-hub/internal/observability/siem/bridge.go` holds the `Bridge`. Its
active sink and active config are stored in atomic pointers so configuration can be
swapped without stopping the poll loop.

Each `Poll` cycle:

1. **Reload config.** `Reload` re-reads the `siem.config` row from `system_metadata`
   at the head of every cycle. A missing row, `enabled = false`, or an empty URL
   collapses the active sink to nil, and the cycle becomes a no-op. This is what
   lets an admin enable or reconfigure SIEM and have it take effect within one poll
   interval, with no restart and no shadow plumbing.
2. **Load checkpoints.** Two independent keyset checkpoints live in
   `system_metadata`: one for traffic events, one for admin events. Each
   checkpoint is a `(timestamp, id)` cursor stored as a JSON object
   (`{"ts":…,"id":…}`); a missing checkpoint defaults to 24 hours ago with an
   empty id. The two cursors advance independently so a burst in one table does
   not stall the other.
3. **Query new rows.** Each table is queried for rows *after* its keyset cursor —
   `WHERE timestamp > ts OR (timestamp = ts AND id > id)` — ordered by
   `(timestamp, id)` ascending, limited to the batch size. The `id` tiebreaker is
   load-bearing: `timestamp` has millisecond resolution, so a timestamp-only
   cursor would permanently skip rows that share the boundary millisecond beyond
   the batch limit. Pairing the timestamp with the row id makes the cursor total,
   so no boundary row is ever lost.
4. **Classify** each row into an `eventType` (see [§4](#4-classification)).
5. **Filter** the merged batch by the configured `eventTypes` whitelist (an empty
   whitelist forwards everything).
6. **Send** the batch through the active sink.
7. **Advance checkpoints** — but only after a successful send, and only for the
   tables that produced rows. This ordering makes delivery at-least-once: a send
   failure leaves the checkpoints unmoved, so the next cycle retries the same rows.
   The external SIEM is expected to dedupe on the event `id`.

`Poll` is serialized by a mutex, so cycles never overlap. Defaults are a 30-second
poll interval and a batch size of 200.

### Traffic rows are security-relevant only

The traffic query returns only security-relevant rows: those where either pipeline
stage (request or response hook) blocked the request, or flagged it `rate_limited`
or `budget_exceeded`. Ordinary allowed traffic is not forwarded — an external SIEM
wants policy and security signal, not a copy of every request. Admin audit rows are
forwarded in full, since each one is a privileged mutation worth retaining.

Each forwarded traffic row carries both pipeline stages — `requestHook*` and
`responseHook*` fields — plus flat `hookDecision` / `hookReason` / `hookReasonCode`
aliases (preferring the response stage when both are present) so existing SIEM
dashboards that key on a single decision field keep matching.

## 3. Sink and wire formats

The transport is a pluggable `Sink` interface
(`packages/nexus-hub/internal/observability/siem/sink.go`), with one
implementation: `HTTPSink`. It POSTs each batch to the configured URL with the
configured headers (typically an auth token such as `Authorization: Splunk <token>`).
A non-2xx response is an error, which leaves the checkpoint unmoved so the batch is
retried on the next cycle. The single HTTP sink is vendor-agnostic — Splunk HEC,
Datadog, Elastic, and generic webhooks are all HTTP endpoints distinguished only by
URL and headers.

**Egress SSRF guard.** The webhook URL is operator-supplied, so the sink client
installs a dial-time SSRF guard (`nexushttp.BlockPrivateDialControl`) that refuses
to connect to a loopback / RFC-1918 private / link-local (incl. cloud-metadata
169.254.169.254) / ULA address. The check runs on the concrete resolved address,
so it also defeats DNS-rebinding at delivery time. Without it, a principal who can
reconfigure the URL could exfiltrate the org-wide audit stream to an internal host
or pivot into the Hub's network. The guard is scoped to the sink client only — the
Hub still dials its own private dependencies normally — and shares one
implementation with the OIDC discovery fetcher (single source of truth in
`packages/shared/transport/http/ssrf.go`).

The payload shape is chosen by a `Formatter`
(`packages/nexus-hub/internal/observability/siem/formatter.go`). Three formats are
available, selected by the `format` config field:

- `json` (default) — the batch as a JSON array.
- `cef` — one ArcSight Common Event Format line per event, with a severity derived
  from the event type (see below).
- `syslog` — one RFC 5424 syslog line per event, facility `local0`, with a severity
  derived from the event type (see below).

CEF/syslog severity is derived from the **canonical event taxonomy** the classifier
actually emits, not from string prefixes
(`packages/nexus-hub/internal/observability/siem/severity.go`). The resource half
of the `eventType` (the part before the first `.`) is looked up in the canonical
IAM catalog and mapped by service: IAM and platform resources (identity, policy,
node, settings) and the secret-management `credential` resource score elevated;
kill-switch and emergency-passthrough toggles score critical; authentication
failure scores high; compliance config and blocked traffic score moderate; gateway
data-plane events and rate/budget signals score low; everything else defaults to
informational. Keying on the catalog means a new resource inherits a sensible
severity automatically and a privilege-grade mutation can never be exported as
low-severity noise.

The line-oriented `cef` and `syslog` formats are hardened against log injection: every
event field is passed through the format-specific escaper and then a control-character
sanitiser before it is written. Carriage return and line feed are rendered as the literal
two-character sequences `\r` and `\n`, and all other control bytes are dropped, so an
attacker-controlled value — for example the unauthenticated email surfaced as the actor
label on a failed admin login — cannot embed a newline to forge an additional CEF or
syslog record. The newline that separates records in a batch is emitted by the formatter
itself, never sourced from event data. The `json` format is inherently safe because the
encoder escapes control characters.

## 4. Classification

Each row is mapped to an `eventType` string before filtering and forwarding
(`packages/nexus-hub/internal/observability/siem/classify.go`):

- **Traffic events** map from the hook decision and reason code: a block flagged
  `rate_limited` becomes `traffic.rate_limited`, a block flagged `budget_exceeded`
  becomes `traffic.budget_exceeded`, any other block becomes `traffic.request_blocked`.
- **Admin events** map to the canonical `{resource}.{verb}` form (for example
  `virtual-key.create`), matching the IAM catalog so the same string appears in IAM
  policy and in the SIEM filter.
- **Legacy-shaped admin events** are mapped to their cataloged identities so they
  are not silently dropped by a whitelist (and so they appear in the picker):
  login rows (`admin.login.failed` / `admin.login.succeeded`, whose entityType is
  absent or inconsistent) become `auth.login_failure` / `auth.login_success`, and
  node override / break-glass writes (`thing` / `thing_override_set`) become
  `node.write-override`.

The `eventTypes` whitelist on the config filters which of these the bridge forwards.
Because every emitted event type is cataloged and offered in the picker, enabling a
whitelist never silently drops a class of security events.

## 5. Scheduler integration

The bridge runs as a Hub scheduler job
(`packages/nexus-hub/internal/jobs/defs/audit/siem_bridge.go`, id `siem-bridge`)
whose `Run` simply calls `Bridge.Poll`. `Poll` handles its own errors by logging
and never panics, so the job always reports success to the scheduler. The job is
always registered; because `Reload` runs at the head of every cycle, it stays a
cheap no-op until an admin enables `siem.config`, at which point the next cycle
begins forwarding — no restart required.

## 6. Admin configuration surface

The Control Plane owns the admin API
(`packages/control-plane/internal/observability/siem/handler/`). It is reached
under the admin API group. **Read** is gated on the audit-log resource; the
**egress-mutating** verbs are gated on the higher-blast-radius `settings:write`
tier:

| Route | Verb | IAM | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `/settings/siem` | GET | audit-log read | Read the current config (auth headers masked) |
| `/settings/siem` | PUT | **settings write** | Save the config (validates format and URL; audit-logged) |
| `/settings/siem/test` | POST | **settings write** | Send a one-off probe event to the configured endpoint |
| `/settings/siem/event-types` | GET | audit-log read | List selectable event types for the filter picker |

The split is deliberate: reconfiguring the egress redirects the **entire org's**
audit stream to an operator-supplied URL (and the probe POST is an SSRF primitive
— see the egress guard in §3), so it is a system-integration setting, not an
audit-log record operation. Gating the mutating verbs on `settings:write` (the
verb also used by `health:reset`) means a narrow `audit-log:write` grant can no
longer point the audit firehose at an attacker endpoint, while audit viewers keep
read-only visibility of the redacted config. The CP UI mirrors this: the SIEM tab
loads under `audit-log:read` but the Save/Test affordances render only with
`settings:write`, keeping UI `allowedActions` in lockstep with the handler gate.
The `/settings/siem/test` response reflects only a generic reachable/unreachable
boolean — never the raw upstream status code or transport error — so it cannot be
used as an oracle to fingerprint internal endpoints.

The config — `enabled`, `url`, `format`, `headers`, and the `eventTypes` whitelist —
is persisted as the `siem.config` row in `system_metadata`. The PUT validates that
`format` is one of `json` / `cef` / `syslog` and that `url` is an HTTP(S) URL. The
GET masks the `Authorization` and `x-api-key` header values so secrets are never
echoed back to the UI. Saving the config is itself recorded in the admin audit log.

The event-type picker is sourced from `/settings/siem/event-types`, which returns
the security-relevant `traffic.*` types, the `auth.login_failure` /
`auth.login_success` login types, and one entry per `(resource, verb)` pair in the
canonical IAM catalog (which already includes `node.write-override`), so the admin
UI can offer a service → resource → event-type drill-down that mirrors the IAM
policy editor. The hand-listed `traffic.*` and `auth.*` entries cover the
classifier outputs that do not correspond to a catalog `(resource, verb)` pair.

Because the bridge re-reads `siem.config` every poll cycle, a saved change
propagates within one poll interval without any restart or shadow push.

## 7. Correlation

Every forwarded row carries the `trace_id` (the `X-Nexus-Request-Id` value stamped
on the originating request). A SIEM operator can pivot on that id to correlate a
forwarded event back to the full set of `traffic_event` rows for the same request
across services. The correlation-key model is described in
[observability-architecture.md](observability-architecture.md).
