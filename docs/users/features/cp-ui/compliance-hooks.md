# Control Plane UI — Compliance: hooks and policies

This document covers the hooks-and-policy part of the COMPLIANCE sidebar section: **Overview**, **Hooks & Policies**, **Rule Packs**, and **Exemptions**. The network-interception part (Interception Domains, AI Guard Backend, Streaming Compliance, Payload Capture) is in [compliance-network.md](./compliance-network.md), and the records part (Operation Logs, Data Subject Requests, Compliance Report) is in [compliance-records.md](./compliance-records.md). Sidebar labels and routes are defined in `packages/control-plane-ui/src/routes/shellRouteConfig.tsx`.

## Overview

**Purpose.** A global enforcement-health dashboard across the three intercept layers for a selected time window.

**What you see.** A time-range filter bar (presets 24h / 7d / 30d / custom, plus Refresh and Export CSV); four KPI cards — total requests, blocked, TLS coverage, hook errors; an **Enforcement Trinity** row of three cards (AI Gateway, Network Proxy, Agent), each showing events, blocked, and TLS coverage with decision badges; a **Hook Decision Health** panel (total / allow / deny / error / unknown counts, p50 / p95 / p99 latency, and top deny reason codes); and a **Top Blocked** table tabbed by target host, reason code, and source IP.

**Controls.** The page is read-only; the only action is the CSV export, whose window is capped at 366 days.

**Key concepts.** Each intercept layer reports a per-request decision — `APPROVE`, `MODIFY`, `REJECT_HARD`, `BLOCK_SOFT`, or `ABSTAIN`. Hook-level decisions roll up as allow, deny, error, or unknown.

**Where the data comes from.** `complianceApi.getOverview`; the export uses `complianceApi.buildOverviewExportUrl`.

## Hooks & Policies

**Purpose.** Configure which hooks run on traffic, at which stage, in what order, and how each one is set up.

**List page.** Pipeline tabs (All / Request / Response) sit above a table with columns: name, category, stage, status (an enable/disable switch), priority, and actions (view, delete). A create button opens the form; the list has a search box and an enabled filter. A collapsible **Hook Pipeline** panel shows the execution chain and reorders hooks with up/down controls.

**Create and detail.** The form collects name, `type` (built-in, webhook, or script), `stage` (request or response), a category override, `priority`, `timeoutMs`, `failBehavior` (fail-open or fail-closed), the enabled flag, and `applicableIngress` (ALL, AI_GATEWAY, COMPLIANCE_PROXY, or AGENT). An `implementationId` select is populated from the hook registry and filtered by stage and type — a built-in hook picks one of the eleven implementations (`keyword-filter`, `pii-detector`, `content-safety`, `rate-limiter`, `request-size-validator`, `ip-access-filter`, `data-residency`, `rulepack-engine`, `noop`, `webhook-forward`, `quality-checker`); a webhook hook forwards to an external endpoint; a script hook runs an inline script. A JSON-schema-driven config panel (or a manual JSON editor) sets the implementation's parameters. The detail page has Overview, Configuration, Pipeline, Rule Packs (shown for `content-safety`, `keyword-filter`, `pii-detector`, and `rulepack-engine`), and Test tabs.

**Key concepts.** A content-touching hook carries an `onMatch` policy with two independent actions: the `inflightAction` decides what happens to the live request — `approve`, `block-hard`, `block-soft`, or `redact` — and the `storageAction` decides what is persisted — `keep`, `redact`, or `drop-content`. Categories are compliance, traffic_control, quality, observability, or custom.

**Where the data comes from.** `hookApi` — `list`, `get`, `create`, `update`, `delete`, `test`, `getImplementations`, `getExecutionChain`, `reorder`.

## Rule Packs

**Purpose.** Author or import versioned rule packs and bind them to the hooks that consume rules.

**List page.** A maintainer filter sits above a table with columns: name (a link), version, maintainer, created, and a delete action. The toolbar offers Import YAML and Create.

**Create, import, bind, and override.** Creation collects name, version, maintainer, an optional description, and the rules — in a form mode or a JSON mode; each rule has a rule id, category, severity, pattern, and optional flags, labels, and description. Import pastes a YAML pack, previews it (surfacing warnings and errors), then imports. Binding picks a pack family, pins a version, and installs it onto a rule-pack-consuming hook. The overrides panel sets, per install, a per-rule disabled flag and a severity override against that install's effective rule set.

**Key concepts.** A rule's severity is `hard`, `soft`, or `info`. A pack is versioned, and each install pins a specific version; overrides are scoped to a single install rather than the source pack.

**Where the data comes from.** `rulePacksApi` — `list`, `create`, `get`, `update`, `delete`, `import`, `preview`, `install`, `uninstall`, `listInstallsForHook`, `patchInstall`, `effectiveRules`, `upsertOverrides`.

## Exemptions

**Purpose.** Grant a time-bounded source/target carve-out that bypasses the compliance hooks for matching traffic. The traffic is still TLS-bumped — an exemption skips hook evaluation, not interception.

**List page.** A single list unifies active grants and pending requests, with a status filter (All, Effective, Oncoming, Pending, Expired) and columns: id, status (with a disabled badge for inactive grants), source IP, target host, effective-from, expiry (relative), reason, requested-by, approved-by, and created. Row actions branch by kind — grants offer enable / disable and delete (deletable only before activation); pending requests offer approve / reject. A create button opens the form.

**Create and detail.** Creation collects a source IP or CIDR, a target host, a duration (chosen from preset minutes), a reason (4 to 500 characters), and a "submit as pending" checkbox that creates a pending request for approval rather than an immediate grant. The detail page is a read-only key-value view with the same lifecycle actions; rejecting a request requires a note.

**Key concepts.** A list row's `kind` is either grant or pending. A grant's status is `effective`, `oncoming`, `pending`, or `expired`, and an inactive grant carries a disabled flag. The activation time gates whether a grant can still be deleted.

**Where the data comes from.** `complianceApi` — `listExemptions`, `getExemption`, `createExemptionGrant`, `createPendingExemptionRequest`, `deleteExemptionGrant`, `approveExemption`, `rejectExemption`, `patchExemptionGrant`.
