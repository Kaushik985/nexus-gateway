# Cache multi-tier architecture

The Nexus Gateway response cache short-circuits live upstream calls for AI Gateway requests whose inputs the gateway has seen before. The cache emits a billable `traffic_event` row at the would-have-paid upstream cost and stamps a `gateway_cache_savings_usd` field for analytics, so a HIT is observable end-to-end without losing the spend-attribution that the cache replaced.

The cache is two-tier:

- **L1** — exact-match response cache keyed by a canonicalised request body hash. Backed by Redis (string `SET` / `GET`).
- **L2** — semantic vector cache. Backed by Valkey's `valkey-search` module (`FT.CREATE` HNSW index + `FT.SEARCH`). Looked up only when L1 misses.

A third sibling — the in-flight singleflight broker — coalesces concurrent MISS callers for the same key onto one upstream call and one cache write; joiners are stamped as `hit_inflight` instead of `miss`.

What the cache does **not** serve:

- Requests with the `x-nexus-aigw-no-cache` header (`gateway_cache_status=skipped`, reason `no_cache`).
- Requests whose `ResolvedRequest.Passthrough.BypassCache` flag is set by an emergency passthrough rule (`skipped`, reason `passthrough`).
- Requests classified as time-sensitive by the freshness detector when the runtime `applyFreshnessRules` knob is on (`skipped`, reason `time_sensitive`).
- Requests with no resolvable routing target or with the cache module not wired (`skipped`, reason `disabled`).
- Upstream failures — the broker's leader path returns the error directly; no entry is written.
- Entries exceeding the per-tier size cap (L1: 1 MiB default; L2: 256 KiB default).

Streaming and non-streaming requests both cache; the L1 schema discriminator (`stream/v1` vs `response/v1`) prevents one being decoded as the other.

## L1 — exact-match response cache

`cache/core.Cache` is a Redis-backed key/value store keyed on a SHA-256 of the request inputs. The receiver is safe on `nil` (every method short-circuits to a no-op), so the gateway can run without a cache wired.

**Two entry types**, both carrying an `OriginWireShape typology.WireShape` tag (see § OriginWireShape tagging):

- `StreamEntry` — schema `stream/v1`. Carries the full upstream chunk timeline (`[]ChunkRecord`) including each chunk's raw SSE/NDJSON bytes so HIT replay is byte-equivalent to the original upstream response. Usage totals, upstream HTTP headers, and provider + model are preserved.
- `ResponseEntry` — schema `response/v1`. Carries the canonical (or upstream-shape) response JSON, usage totals, and upstream headers.

`LookupStream` / `LookupResponse` enforce the schema discriminator on read — a value stored as `response/v1` is invisible to a `LookupStream` call. `StoreStream` / `StoreResponse` enforce a `maxEntryBytes` cap (default 1 MiB) and return `ErrCacheEntryTooLarge` on oversize; oversize entries are silently skipped on the write path.

**Hot-swappable runtime knobs** (`Cache.SetConfig`):

- `Enabled` — atomic bool. When false, both `Lookup*` and `Store*` short-circuit to no-ops.
- `TTL` — nanosecond-precision Redis SET TTL. Default 1 hour.
- `ApplyFreshnessRules` — gates whether the proxy's pre-lookup classifier honours a freshness detector match.

The proxy reads these through `IsEnabled()` / `ApplyFreshnessRules()` on the hot path; the values are pushed via the Hub shadow (`response_cache.extract_config`) and dispatched into `SetConfig` without restarting the service.

**Yaml-only knobs** (set once at boot, since changing them invalidates existing entries):

- `Prefix` — Redis key prefix (default `nexus:cache`).
- `MaxEntryBytes` — per-entry size cap.

## Cache key

`Cache.BuildKey(provider, model, body, allowlistVersion) → "<prefix>:<sha256>"` produces the L1 cache key. Inputs:

1. A schema version header `v3\n` pinning the key layout — older keys are unreachable.
2. The upstream **provider name** and **provider model id** (the strings the gateway will send to the wire, not the client-facing alias).
3. The **canonicalised JSON body** — object keys sorted recursively at every nesting level, array order preserved. Non-JSON bodies pass through unchanged. This guarantees that semantically identical requests with different SDK key orderings collide on the same key.
4. The **forward-header allowlist version hash** — folded in so a yaml allowlist change invalidates entries whose `UpstreamHeaders` were recorded under a different effective filter.

The body that's hashed is the output of the provider adapter's `PrepareBody`, not the raw client body. That folds out cross-format ingress differences (Anthropic ingress → OpenAI target produces the same key whether the caller hit `/v1/messages` or `/v1/chat/completions`).

The proxy also runs an optional `Normaliser.NormalizeKey` step on the prepared body before hashing. This strips volatile fields (e.g. provider billing nonces) that would otherwise force every request to miss. The mutation is key-only; the upstream call still receives the unmodified prepared body.

## L2 — semantic vector cache

`cache/semantic` writes entries to a Valkey `valkey-search` HNSW index and looks them up via approximate-nearest-neighbour cosine search.

**`FT.CREATE` schema** (per index):

```
SCHEMA
  vector            VECTOR HNSW 12 DIM <dim> TYPE FLOAT32 DISTANCE_METRIC COSINE M 16 EF_CONSTRUCTION 200 EF_RUNTIME 10
  upstream_provider TAG
  upstream_model    TAG
  vk_scope          TAG
  response_kind     TAG
  fingerprint       TAG
  cached_at         NUMERIC
```

`response_body`, `usage`, and `origin_wire_shape` are payload-only HASH fields — written but NOT indexed. The reader retrieves them via `FT.SEARCH ... RETURN`, which works against unindexed fields.

**Per-entry key**: `<indexName>:<sha256(EmbeddingInput)[:16]>` — 16 hex chars from a SHA-256 over the exact text fed to the embedding model. The same hash drives the L2 entry's poison-list key (see § Poisoning).

**Lookup query**:

```
(@vk_scope:{<vk>} @response_kind:{<kind>} @fingerprint:{<fp>}
 [@upstream_provider:{<p>} @upstream_model:{<m>}])
 =>[KNN 1 @vector $vec AS __vector_score]
```

The `upstream_provider` / `upstream_model` clauses are dropped when the caller sets `AllowCrossModel`. Tag values are escaped for `,` and `|` (the search module's TAG separator and OR operator); `-` is intentionally NOT escaped because Valkey-search's TAG dialect treats it as a literal — escaping breaks UUID-shaped scopes.

**Threshold + scoring**: `valkey-search` returns cosine distance in `[0, 2]`; the reader inverts via `similarity = clamp(1 − distance/2, 0, 1)`. A hit with `similarity < Threshold` is treated as a miss. The default threshold floor is 0.96 (rejected as out-of-range otherwise).

**Per-search hard timeout**: 20 ms. On timeout the reader returns nil and the caller stamps `gateway_cache_skip_reason = semantic_search_timeout`.

**Embedding cost stamp**: every L2 lookup that issues an embedding call records the embedding USD cost into `traffic_event.embedding_cost_usd` and the embedding model id into `traffic_event.embedding_model_id`, regardless of whether the lookup hit, missed, or skipped. The L2 read path uses an `EmbeddingSingleflight` so concurrent identical inputs share one embedding call.

**Eligibility — `EffectiveEnabled()`**: the L2 cache is only consulted when the runtime fleet-wide enabled flag is on AND the embedding provider id, embedding model id, and embedding dimension are all populated. A missing embedding model produces `skip_disabled` and falls through to the broker.

## Lookup order + write-back

The proxy's cache phase runs after request hooks and before the broker. Per request:

1. **Pre-lookup classifier** — `classifyCachePreLookup` returns either `(skipped, <reason>)` (cache disabled, no-cache header, passthrough bypass, no routing target, time-sensitive freshness match) or `("", "")` (proceed).
2. **L1 lookup** — `Cache.LookupStream` or `Cache.LookupResponse` against the canonical key. On hit, stamp `gateway_cache_status = hit`, `gateway_cache_kind = extract`, `provider_cache_status = na`, and dispatch into the HIT pipeline.
3. **L2 lookup on L1 miss** — `Handler.tryL2Lookup` runs unconditionally; returns false (and the caller proceeds to the broker) when the L2 reader is not wired or the per-route policy disables semantic. On hit, stamp `gateway_cache_status = hit`, `gateway_cache_kind = semantic`, `gateway_cache_l2_entry_key = <reader entry key>`, `provider_cache_status = na`.
4. **Broker path on full miss** — `streamcache.Registry.Subscribe(key, leaderFn)` returns `(subscription, isFirst, err)`. The first subscriber's `leaderFn` fires the live upstream call and stamps `gateway_cache_status = miss`; joiners share the in-flight stream and stamp `gateway_cache_status = hit_inflight`.
5. **L2 write-back** — on the leader's terminal frame, `Handler.scheduleL2Write` fires a goroutine with a 5-second deadline that embeds the canonical prompt text and HSETs an L2 entry. L1 write-back is internal to the broker's `writeCache` step (single canonical timeline regardless of how many joiners attached).

Joiners do NOT issue upstream calls and do NOT reconcile against the quota counter — the leader pays the upstream cost and reconciles its own quota.

## OriginWireShape tagging

Every L1 entry (both `StreamEntry` and `ResponseEntry`) and every L2 entry carries a single `OriginWireShape typology.WireShape` field that records the wire shape the entry was produced under. The cache HIT comparison is one equality test:

```go
// packages/ai-gateway/internal/ingress/proxy/proxy_cache.go
sameShape := entry.OriginWireShape == ingress.WireShape
```

When the shapes differ, the cache layer hands the entry body to `CanonicalBridge.ResponseAcrossFormats(from, to typology.WireShape, body []byte) ([]byte, error)`. The reshape pipeline is:

1. Decode `from`-shape body to canonical chat-completion JSON (via the source codec's `DecodeResponse`, or `openai.DecodeResponsesResponse` when `from == WireShapeOpenAIResponses`).
2. Re-encode canonical to `to`-shape via `ResponseCanonicalToIngress(toFormat, canonical)`.

`from == to` short-circuits and returns the body unchanged.

Entries that carry an empty `OriginWireShape` (any write path that omits tagging) take the reader's untagged branch — a canonical-assuming reshape gate that re-encodes when the requesting ingress is `WireShapeOpenAIChat` or `WireShapeOpenAIResponses` against a non-Responses-native target. The same wire-shape gate exists for the streaming path: when the cached chunks were written under a different ingress shape, the proxy stamps a stream-hit origin on the request context, and `handleStreamWithSubscription` selects an explicit `NewChatCompletionsStreamEncoder` / `NewResponsesStreamEncoder` so the cached canonical chunks are re-encoded into the requesting ingress's SSE grammar instead of forwarding the writer's raw bytes.

`OriginWireShape` is stored at the storage layer as a TEXT HASH field on L2 (`origin_wire_shape`, written by `Client.StoreEntry`, returned by `FT.SEARCH ... RETURN`). The L2 index does NOT index it — every reshape decision is post-retrieval at the reader.

For the underlying `WireShape` typology and the routes table see [`endpoint-typology-architecture.md`](../foundation/endpoint-typology-architecture.md).

## Cache status fields on the traffic event

The audit record (and downstream `TrafficEventMessage`) carries six cache columns. Four are detail / drill-down only; one is the unified rollup; one points the admin UI at the underlying L2 entry.

| Field | Type | Producer |
|---|---|---|
| `CacheStatus` | enum `HIT` \| `MISS` | `DeriveCacheStatus(GatewayCacheStatus, ProviderCacheStatus)` — HIT iff gateway served (`hit` or `hit_inflight`) OR upstream reported a provider-side prompt cache hit. |
| `GatewayCacheStatus` | enum `hit` \| `hit_inflight` \| `miss` \| `skipped` | Stamped by the proxy at the lookup branch (extract HIT, semantic HIT, broker leader, broker joiner, or pre-lookup classifier). |
| `GatewayCacheSkipReason` | enum (17 values) | Set only when `GatewayCacheStatus = skipped`. Vocabulary: `disabled / no_cache / passthrough / not_cacheable / time_sensitive / oversize_for_embedding / valkey_unavailable / embedding_timeout / embedding_provider_error / embedding_dim_mismatch / semantic_search_error / semantic_search_timeout / semantic_reindex_in_progress / semantic_unavailable / embedding_circuit_open / embedding_budget_exceeded / poisoned`. |
| `GatewayCacheKind` | enum `extract` \| `semantic` | Distinguishes L1 hits (`extract`) from L2 hits (`semantic`). |
| `GatewayCacheL2EntryKey` | string | The L2 Redis HASH key (`<index>:<sha256[:16]>`). Stamped only on rows where `GatewayCacheKind = semantic`. The admin UI uses this as the entry id the gateway's poison check will match against. |
| `ProviderCacheStatus` | enum `hit` \| `miss` \| `na` | Reports the upstream provider's own prompt-cache outcome from the upstream usage envelope. `na` on every gateway-served row (the upstream wasn't called). |

The unified `CacheStatus` is the only column the audit drawer exposes to UI filters. The four detail columns are drill-down only; their § 6.4 layout in [`cost-estimation-architecture.md`](../../services/ai-gateway/cost-estimation-architecture.md) is the source of truth for how the drawer renders them.

## Cost stamp on cache HIT

The cache short-circuits the upstream call but still emits a `traffic_event` row, so dashboards can show "spend if no cache" alongside "savings".

- `EstimatedCostUsd` — the would-have-paid cost at the model's current input/output USD-per-million prices. Computed via `estimator.Lookup(EndpointType)(BillableUnits{prompt, completion}, ModelPrices{...}).Total` on both stream HIT and non-stream HIT paths. Invariant of cache outcome.
- `GatewayCacheSavingsUsd` — set equal to `EstimatedCostUsd` on extract HIT and semantic HIT (this caller did not pay upstream).
- Token counts (`PromptTokens` / `CompletionTokens` / `TotalTokens` / `ReasoningTokens`) on a HIT come from the cached entry's usage envelope so the row carries the same totals the original upstream call produced.

**HIT_LIVE (joiner) cost clearing**. When the broker subscriber is a joiner, `EstimatedCostUsd` is reset to 0 and `GatewayCacheSavingsUsd` is set to the full would-have-cost — the leader (which stamps `miss`) owns the upstream spend; charging the joiner would double-count. Provider-side prompt-cache token / cost fields (`CacheReadTokens`, `CacheCreationTokens`, `CacheWriteCostUsd`, `CacheReadSavingsUsd`, `CacheNetSavingsUsd`) are cleared on the joiner row for the same reason.

**Quota reconcile is skipped** when `gatewayServed := GatewayCacheStatus ∈ {hit, hit_inflight}`. HIT and HIT_INFLIGHT both mean this caller paid no upstream cost; reconciling would inflate the quota counter against zero spend.

## Poisoning — negative-feedback path

Admins can mark a semantic cache HIT as a bad result via the audit drawer's thumbs-down. The mechanism:

- **Backing store**: Redis `SET` keys under namespace `nexus:l2:poison:<vkScope>:<entryKey>`, value `"1"`. TTL = `min(entry_remaining_ttl × 10, 30 days)`, default 24 h × 10 when the entry TTL is unknown.
- **Reader-side check**: `cache/semantic.Reader.Read` calls `PoisonList.IsPoisoned(ctx, entryKey, vkScope)` after every FT.SEARCH hit. A `true` result is treated as a miss and stamped `gateway_cache_skip_reason = poisoned`. A poison-list lookup error is fail-open — the hit still proceeds; a poison-list availability issue must not degrade normal cache ops.
- **Admin endpoint**: `POST /api/admin/cache/semantic-feedback` with body `{entryKey, vkScope, reason, ttlSeconds}`. The Control Plane's `redisPoisonAdder` writes the same `nexus:l2:poison:<vkScope>:<entryKey>` key so the gateway and the Control Plane share one namespace. IAM action: `admin:semantic-cache.update`. The handler also records the feedback in a process-local ring buffer (capacity 1000) so the audit drawer's "recent feedback" panel can render without a DB roundtrip.
- **Why `GatewayCacheL2EntryKey` exists**: the entry id the gateway's `IsPoisoned` check compares against is the L2 Redis HASH key, not the `traffic_event.id`. Stamping it on the audit row gives the admin UI the right token to post back.

## Spillstore

The cache layer does NOT delegate to the spillstore. The two systems are independent: spillstore archives request and response payload bytes for the `traffic_event` row when payload capture is enabled and the body exceeds an inline-byte cap; the cache stores upstream responses keyed for replay. See [`spillstore-architecture.md`](spillstore-architecture.md) for the spill path.

## Eviction + freshness

**L1 eviction** is pure Redis TTL — `SET key value EX <ttl>` at write time, default 1 h, runtime-tunable via Hub shadow. There is no in-process LRU on the gateway side; the eviction policy is whatever the Redis instance is configured with (`maxmemory-policy`).

**L2 eviction** is per-entry `PEXPIRE` set at write time, plus index-level lifecycle. The L2 config snapshot carries a `Fingerprint = sha256(provider:model:dim)` and an explicit `RedisIndexName` (e.g. `nexus:semantic-cache:v1`). When the fingerprint changes — embedding provider, model, or dimension swap — a blue/green index rotation drops the stale index and recreates with the new dimension. Stale entries are unreachable behind the new fingerprint TAG filter even before the index drop.

**Freshness — time-sensitive skip**. `cache/freshness.Detector` is a hot-swappable rule set evaluated over the canonical message stream. When `Cache.ApplyFreshnessRules()` is true AND `Detector.IsTimeSensitive(messages)` matches, `classifyCachePreLookup` returns `(skipped, time_sensitive)` so both L1 and L2 are bypassed. The detector's rule list is loaded from the Hub shadow and replaced atomically via `Detector.Reload` — no restart required.

**Poisoning** (above) is the third eviction-adjacent path: a poisoned L2 entry remains in Valkey but is invisible to FT.SEARCH-driven reads until the poison key TTL elapses or the entry's own TTL evicts it.
