// hook MUST refuse the CONNECT (403) rather than "fail open" and establish an
// uninspected tunnel — the exact gap the G6 verify round found (the strict
// build error was generated and then logged-and-ignored).

// Contrast: a fail-OPEN hook that cannot build is skipped and the CONNECT
// proceeds (covered by TestServeHTTP_ConnectionStage_*_FailOpen). The
