# Compliance Proxy runtime API architecture

The Compliance Proxy exposes an operator-facing runtime HTTP API — separate from
the Control Plane admin API — plus the shadow-driven local state behind it: the
kill switch, temporary exemptions, break-glass overrides, and config loading.
This doc covers that control surface.

## What this doc covers (and what it does not)

The request data path (CONNECT, access, forward gate) is in
[compliance-proxy-connect-forward-architecture.md](compliance-proxy-connect-forward-architecture.md);
certificate handling in
[compliance-proxy-tls-cert-architecture.md](compliance-proxy-tls-cert-architecture.md).
The kill-switch propagation model across services is owned by
[kill-switch-architecture.md](../../cross-cutting/safety/kill-switch-architecture.md);
the Hub config-sync model by
[thing-config-sync-architecture.md](../../cross-cutting/foundation/thing-config-sync-architecture.md).
This doc describes the proxy-local implementation.

## 1. Runtime HTTP API

`runtime.Server` (`packages/compliance-proxy/internal/runtime/server`) registers
the operator surfaces:

- `GET /healthz` — liveness/readiness, **no auth** (for probes).
- `GET /metrics` — Prometheus scrape.
- `GET /connections` — active-connection snapshot.
- `GET /runtime/config`, `GET /runtime/config/{key}`, `GET /runtime/sync-status`,
  `GET /runtime/health` — shadow-aligned read surfaces.
- `PUT /runtime/config/{key}` — break-glass write.

Every surface except `/healthz` is wrapped by `tokenAuth.Require`.
`runtime.auth.TokenAuth` loads `COMPLIANCE_PROXY_API_TOKEN` and compares with
`subtle.ConstantTimeCompare`; when the variable is unset, auth is disabled and a
warning is logged (dev mode).

## 2. Kill switch (local state)

`runtime.killswitch.KillSwitch` (`packages/compliance-proxy/internal/runtime/killswitch`)
is the local state behind the forward-path `IsEngaged` check, which is a
lock-free `atomic.Bool` read on the hot path. `Toggle` sets the state and records
bounded in-memory history; `ForceClose` disengages and closes all currently
bumped connections (via a registered force-close func); `ApplyBreakGlass` applies
a break-glass payload. State is driven by the Hub shadow — there is no local
persistence and no cross-instance publisher.

## 3. Break-glass overrides

`runtime.breakglass` (`packages/compliance-proxy/internal/runtime/breakglass`) is
the local override path when the Hub is unreachable. `PUT /runtime/config/{key}`
decodes the raw payload and dispatches to a per-key `ApplyBreakGlass` branch — a
malformed payload fails with `400` before anything is applied. The reported
version is bumped to `max(desired, reported) + 1`, the change is recorded in an
event log, and if Hub delivery fails the mutation is spooled to disk and
reconciled on reconnect. Break-glass is scoped to the keys that support it
(`killswitch`, `exemptions`).

Delivery to Hub uses a **dedicated break-glass wire** (the report carries the
per-key version map plus `reason` / `sourceIp` / `actorTokenId`): the WebSocket
client sends a `shadow_report_break_glass` frame, and the HTTP fallback (plus the
deferred `ReplayPending` retry) POSTs to
`/api/internal/things/shadow/break-glass`. Hub mirrors the client's
`{killswitch, exemptions}` allowlist server-side and validates each state against
its canonical configtypes schema before adoption — a non-allowlisted key or a
malformed shape is rejected, never silently adopted. `killswitch` is adopted into
the fleet-wide template; `exemptions` is adopted as a per-Thing desired override
on the reporting node only. See the kill-switch architecture doc §6 for the
Hub-side authority gate and scope rules.

## 4. Temporary exemptions

`exemption.Store` (`packages/compliance-proxy/internal/exemption`) holds
operator-granted temporary exemptions that let traffic skip the compliance hooks
while still being TLS-bumped — the escape hatch for false-positive blocks. Each
entry matches a source IP (exact or CIDR) and a target host (exact or
`*.example.com` wildcard) and carries an expiry. The store is driven by the Hub
shadow — `Rebuild` atomically replaces the set from the `activeExemptions`
snapshot — with no local persistence; a background `StartCleanup` loop purges
expired entries. The forward gate consults `IsExempt` per flow.

## 5. Config loading and hot-reload

`config/loaders` reads enable-gated rows from PostgreSQL into typed structures —
domain allowlist, hook config, active exemptions, observability config,
payload-capture config. `config/cache` wraps each loader in a generic `Cache[T]`
guarded by a `sync.RWMutex` (fast read-locked hits, write-locked reload on miss
or invalidation) with TTL and metrics. When the Hub pushes a config change, the
command's config dispatcher
(`packages/compliance-proxy/cmd/compliance-proxy/configdispatch`) invalidates the
affected cache and re-applies derived state — for example
`AccessChecker.SwapDomainAllowlist` and `ExemptionStore.Rebuild`.
