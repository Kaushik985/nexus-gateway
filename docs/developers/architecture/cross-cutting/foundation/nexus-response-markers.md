# Nexus Response Markers

Nexus stamps a small set of `X-Nexus-*` HTTP response headers — **markers** — on every response that flows through one of its services. The client reads them to observe what Nexus did: which services the request traversed, whether the cache hit, what the routing layer decided, which hook pipeline ran (and whether it modified the body), where in the chain the request was rejected if it was, and what quota state applied. Markers are the only way clients see Nexus on a successful (200) response — there is no body envelope, no JSON wrapper, no header rename. The wire stays clean; the markers say "Nexus was here, and here is what it did".

Anchor packages:

- `packages/shared/traffic/markers.go` — the **single source of truth** for the marker allowlist (`ExposeHeaders`), the via-chain helper (`PrependVia`), the generic per-hop chain helper (`PrependChain`), the two CORS helpers (`SetExposeHeaders`, `MergeExposeHeaders`), and the canonical hook-outcome formatter (`FormatHookOutcome`).
- `packages/ai-gateway/internal/ingress/proxy/proxy.go` — AI Gateway's direct `w.Header().Set(...)` call sites for every gateway-owned marker.
- `packages/shared/transport/tlsbump/markerhook.go` + `markercontext.go` — the shared marker-injection layer used by Compliance Proxy (`identity="compliance-proxy"`) and the Agent's tlsbump path (`identity="agent"`).
- `packages/agent/internal/network/proxy/marker.go` — `AgentMarker.injectInto`, the agent's MITM-relay-only injection helper.

## 1. Naming convention

- **Both directions use mixed-case `X-Nexus-*`.** Request headers and response headers follow the same canonical mixed-case form (e.g. `X-Nexus-Request-Id`, `X-Nexus-Mode`, `X-Nexus-Hook`). HTTP header names are case-insensitive on the wire and Go's `http.Header.Set` / `Get` canonicalises automatically, but **all literal strings in the codebase use mixed-case** so code reads consistently with what observers see on the wire.
- **No per-service prefix.** Markers are unified — there is one `X-Nexus-Hook`, one `X-Nexus-Mode`, one `X-Nexus-Domain-Rule`, not separate `aigw-` / `cp-` / `agent-` variants. Multi-hop composition is handled by the via-chain alignment described in §4, not by prefixing.
- **`X-Nexus-Request-Id` is the single correlation header.** There is no separate `X-Nexus-Trace-Id` / `X-Nexus-Flow-Id` / `X-Nexus-Correlation-Id`. Every service that needs to thread a request across hops reads and writes this one header. AI Gateway's middleware generates the value if absent; Agent's MITM-relay sets it to the agent flow ID; downstream services log under this single key.
- **The `X-` prefix** is intentional, not a typo. RFC 6648 deprecated `X-` for new headers in 2012, but the existing `X-Nexus-*` family predates strict adherence; consistency within the family matters more than RFC purity.

## 2. The 18-entry catalogue

`packages/shared/traffic/markers.go` defines a slice `ExposeHeaders` — the **authoritative list** of marker headers Nexus exposes to browser-side JavaScript via the `Access-Control-Expose-Headers` CORS header. Every marker either sits in this slice (always exposed) or is omitted entirely from the spec.

### 2.1 Cross-service correlation (2)

| Marker | Set by | Value | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `X-Nexus-Via` | every Nexus service via `traffic.PrependVia` | comma-separated service names, idempotent dedup | The "via chain". Each hop prepends its own name iff not already present. See §4. |
| `X-Nexus-Request-Id` | AI Gateway middleware (`packages/ai-gateway/internal/platform/middleware/middleware.go`); echoed by CP (`stampMarkers`) and Agent (`AgentMarker.injectInto`) | UUID string | The **only** correlation header. AI Gateway generates one if absent on the request; CP and Agent reflect the incoming value (or, in Agent's case, the agent flow ID) onto the response. Same header on request and response. |

### 2.2 AI Gateway request outcome (5)

All set by `packages/ai-gateway/internal/ingress/proxy/proxy.go` (and `proxy_cache.go` for the cache marker).

| Marker | Set by stage | Value | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `X-Nexus-Cache` | response-cache decision | `HIT` \| `MISS` (string-equal to `audit.CacheStatusHit` / `audit.CacheStatusMiss`) | Whether the gateway response cache served this request. |
| `X-Nexus-Routed-Model` | after routing-rule dispatch succeeds (when `result.Substituted`) | model code string | The actual upstream model the routing layer dispatched to. Present only when smart-routing substituted the requested model. |
| `X-Nexus-Routed-Provider` | after routing-rule dispatch succeeds (when `result.Substituted`) | provider name string | The upstream provider that handled the request. Present alongside `X-Nexus-Routed-Model`. |
| `X-Nexus-Attempts` | every gateway response | integer-as-string (≥1) | Number of routing attempts the gateway made. `1` = first-try success; `2+` = at least one L2 retry or L3 failover. Emitted on every response (no `> 0` gate) so observers always see the value. |
| `X-Nexus-Coerced` | after hook pipeline if hooks coerced fields | comma-separated field names | The set of canonical-payload fields the request-hook pipeline coerced (e.g. `temperature,top_p`). Empty when no coercion ran. |

### 2.3 AI Gateway quota (5)

Set by the quota-decision stage in `proxy.go`. Present only on responses where the caller's virtual key has a budget configured.

| Marker | Value | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `X-Nexus-Quota-Used` | `"%.2f"` USD | Current-month cost usage for the caller's virtual key. |
| `X-Nexus-Quota-Limit` | `"%.2f"` USD | Budget limit configured for the caller's virtual key. |
| `X-Nexus-Quota-Downgrade` | `"true"` (only set when downgrade fires) | The routing layer fell back to a cheaper model because the quota policy demanded downgrade-on-threshold-exceeded. |
| `X-Nexus-Quota-Original-Model` | model code string | When `Quota-Downgrade=true`, the original model the client requested (before auto-downgrade). |
| `X-Nexus-Quota-Warning` | free-text message | Operator-facing warning from the quota decision (set when policy returns a warning even on `allow`). |

### 2.4 Per-hop chain markers (2)

These markers compose across hops via `traffic.PrependChain` so the value at index `i` corresponds to the via-chain entry at index `i` (innermost-first ordering — the entry closest to the client is at position 0). See §4 for the alignment contract.

| Marker | Set by | Value contract | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `X-Nexus-Hook` | every Nexus service that runs a hook pipeline (AI Gateway, CP, Agent) | per-hop value follows `FormatHookOutcome` (§3); multi-hop composed via `PrependChain` | Hook-pipeline outcome per hop. |
| `X-Nexus-Mode` | CP + Agent set non-empty values; AI Gateway stamps an empty value to reserve its position | `inspect` \| `deny` \| `mitm` \| `""` (empty, AI Gateway's reserved-position value) | Per-hop service mode. `inspect` = hook pipeline ran (CP / Agent tlsbump). `deny` = synthetic reject response (CP / Agent tlsbump reject path). `mitm` = Agent's MITM relay path. Empty = AI Gateway position holder (it has no mode concept) so outer hops keep 1:1 alignment with the via chain. |

### 2.5 Compliance-proxy domain rule (1)

| Marker | Set by | Value | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `X-Nexus-Domain-Rule` | CP via tlsbump `stampMarkers` / `stampRejectMarkers` | UUID string of matched `Instance.Domain.ID` | The compliance-proxy interception-domain rule that matched the target host. Empty (header omitted) when no domain rule matched (passthrough traffic). CP-only — no chain semantics; only CP can set this header. |

### 2.6 Standard HTTP timing (1)

| Marker | Set by | Value | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Server-Timing` | AI Gateway `proxy.go` | RFC 8674-formatted timing list (e.g. `gw;dur=2, upstream-ttfb;dur=80, upstream-total;dur=140`) | Standard HTTP timing exposed for browser DevTools' Network → Timing panel. Native browser support. |

### 2.7 Attestation (1)

| Marker | Direction | Set by | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `X-Nexus-Attestation` | **request only** in production paths; listed in response `ExposeHeaders` for reverse-proxy edge cases | Agent's attestation signer (`packages/agent/internal/identity/attestation/signer.go`) stamps it on every outbound CONNECT request | Compliance Proxy peeks this on every CONNECT and, if valid, tunnels the flow transparently (skipping MITM + hooks). In the response `ExposeHeaders` allowlist so reverse-proxy deployments that surface the request header back to the client do not strip it; the production response path does not put attestation values on responses. |

### Catalogue totals

| Category | Count |
|---|---|
| 2.1 Correlation | 2 |
| 2.2 AI Gateway outcome | 5 |
| 2.3 AI Gateway quota | 5 |
| 2.4 Per-hop chain (`X-Nexus-Hook`, `X-Nexus-Mode`) | 2 |
| 2.5 CP domain rule | 1 |
| 2.6 HTTP timing | 1 |
| 2.7 Attestation | 1 |
| **Total** | **18** |

The static `ExposeHeaders` slice in `markers.go` has exactly 18 entries — match enforced by `TestExposeHeaders_HasAllMarkers`.

## 3. `FormatHookOutcome` — the per-hop hook-outcome value format

Every per-hop entry in `X-Nexus-Hook` carries one of four shapes, rendered by `FormatHookOutcome` in `packages/shared/traffic/markers.go`:

| Input shape | Rendered value | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `Passed: []`, `Rejected: ""` | `none` | No hook ran (compliance disabled, no hook matched this route, or the pipeline was skipped). |
| `Passed: [a, b]`, `Transformed: false` | `passed:a,b` | Listed hooks all passed; none modified the request body. |
| `Passed: [a, b]`, `Transformed: true` | `transformed:a,b` | Listed hooks all passed; at least one modified the body. |
| `Rejected: hookSlug`, `RejectReason: <free text>` | `rejected:<hookSlug>:<sanitized-reason>` | The pipeline was rejected. Reason text is sanitised. |

**Reason sanitisation** (`sanitizeSlug` helper) lower-cases the input and keeps only `[a-z0-9-]`. Non-allowed character runs collapse into a single hyphen; leading and trailing hyphens are stripped. All-stripped or empty input produces `unknown`. This is what prevents header / log injection from hook reason strings that come from rule-pack metadata: an unsanitised reason like `"PII: SSN detected\r\nX-Evil: x"` would inject a forged header line; after sanitisation it becomes `pii-ssn-detected-x-evil-x`.

**Reject halts the pipeline.** When a hook returns `RejectHard` / `BlockSoft`, any previously-accumulated `Passed` hooks are discarded and the rendered value reports only the reject attribution. This keeps each per-hop entry single-purpose: "this hop reached this outcome", not "this hop did all this and then rejected".

**Multi-hop composition** is the caller's job — outer hops prepend their `FormatHookOutcome` to the existing `X-Nexus-Hook` chain via `PrependChain` (§4). The formatter renders only the single-hop value.

## 4. The via chain + per-hop chain alignment

### Via chain (`PrependVia`)

`PrependVia(h, "<service-name>")` adds the service to the front of the `X-Nexus-Via` header iff not already present (case-insensitive comma-split match). Idempotent: calling it twice with the same name is a no-op.

Production maximum is **2 hops**: any one of `{agent, compliance-proxy}` in front of `ai-gateway`, or a single service alone. There is no production traffic path where all three are chained.

| Path | Resulting `X-Nexus-Via` |
|---|---|
| Client → AI Gateway direct | `ai-gateway` |
| Client → Agent → AI Gateway | `agent, ai-gateway` |
| Client → Compliance Proxy → AI Gateway | `compliance-proxy, ai-gateway` |
| Client → Agent → upstream non-Nexus (passthrough through agent's transparent path) | `agent` |
| Client → Compliance Proxy → upstream non-Nexus | `compliance-proxy` |

Innermost-first ordering — the hop closest to the client comes at position 0, matching the order browsers display in dev tools and HTTP's standard `Via` header.

### Per-hop chain (`PrependChain`)

`PrependChain(h, key, value)` is the generic helper for `X-Nexus-Hook` and `X-Nexus-Mode`. Its contract:

- **First hop (header absent on entry):** `h.Set(key, value)`. The value lands as a single entry.
- **Later hop (header present on entry, even with empty value):** prepend with `, ` separator — `h.Set(key, value+", "+existing)`. The new value lands at position 0; the existing chain shifts right by one.

The "header present but empty" case is the one that preserves strict 1:1 alignment with `X-Nexus-Via`. AI Gateway has no mode concept, so it stamps `X-Nexus-Mode: ""` (empty value, header present) to reserve its position. When an outer hop (agent, CP) then prepends, the result is `X-Nexus-Mode: mitm, ` — trailing empty position for AI Gateway. Reader splits by `,` and trims to `["mitm", ""]`, which aligns 1:1 with `X-Nexus-Via: agent, ai-gateway` → `["agent", "ai-gateway"]`. Reader infers: agent's mode is `mitm`; ai-gateway has no mode (empty position).

Worked examples:

| Path | `X-Nexus-Via` | `X-Nexus-Mode` | `X-Nexus-Hook` |
|---|---|---|---|
| AI Gateway alone, no hook | `ai-gateway` | `` (empty value, header present) | `none` |
| AI Gateway alone, hook ran | `ai-gateway` | `` (empty) | `passed:rate-check` |
| Agent → AI Gateway, both ran hooks | `agent, ai-gateway` | `mitm, ` (trailing empty) | `transformed:redact, passed:rate-check` |
| CP → AI Gateway, CP rejected | `compliance-proxy, ai-gateway` | `deny, ` (trailing empty) | `rejected:pii-detector:contains-ssn, none` |
| CP → AI Gateway, CP inspect-passed | `compliance-proxy, ai-gateway` | `inspect, ` (trailing empty) | `transformed:redact, passed:rate-check` |

Reader parses by `strings.Split(value, ",")` then trims; the resulting slices align 1:1 with the via slice.

## 5. CORS `Access-Control-Expose-Headers` contract

Browsers block JavaScript from reading any response header by default unless the server lists the header name in `Access-Control-Expose-Headers`. Two helpers in `markers.go` populate this:

- **`SetExposeHeaders(h)`** — writes the full `ExposeHeaders` slice, *replacing* any existing value. Use this on synthetic responses (Compliance Proxy reject path's 403/451; AI Gateway origin responses where no upstream CORS state exists) where the marker layer is authoritative.
- **`MergeExposeHeaders(h, names...)`** — appends the given names to any existing value, deduping case-insensitively. Use this on the transparent-proxy success path where an upstream may have already set its own expose list that must be preserved (e.g. the upstream API exposes its own `X-Request-Id` and we must not stomp it).

The choice between the two is a correctness call: a transparent-proxy `Set` would strip upstream CORS state and silently break browser-side code that reads upstream headers; a synthetic-response `Merge` would carry forward irrelevant headers from a previously-cached state if the synthesizer reused an `http.Header` map. The wrong choice does not crash anything — it produces subtle browser-side bugs hard to attribute back to Nexus.

## 6. Per-service injection mechanics

Three distinct code paths produce markers.

### 6.1 AI Gateway — direct `w.Header().Set` calls

`packages/ai-gateway/internal/ingress/proxy/proxy.go` (and `proxy_cache.go` for the cache marker) sets every gateway-owned marker by calling `w.Header().Set("X-Nexus-...", value)` at the relevant pipeline stage:

- Cache decision → `X-Nexus-Cache`
- Routing-rule dispatch → `X-Nexus-Routed-Model`, `X-Nexus-Routed-Provider`, `X-Nexus-Attempts`
- Request-hook completion → `X-Nexus-Hook`, optionally `X-Nexus-Coerced`
- Quota decision → all five `X-Nexus-Quota-*`
- Response timing → `Server-Timing`
- Via stamp + Mode position reservation → `traffic.PrependVia(w.Header(), "ai-gateway")` + `w.Header().Set("X-Nexus-Mode", "")` (the empty Mode stamp is what preserves 1:1 alignment for outer-hop prepends — §4)

`X-Nexus-Request-Id` is set by the middleware in `packages/ai-gateway/internal/platform/middleware/middleware.go` before any handler runs (generates a UUID if the client did not supply one).

### 6.2 Compliance Proxy + Agent (tlsbump path) — `stampMarkers` from context

`packages/shared/transport/tlsbump/markerhook.go` exposes `stampMarkers(ctx, h, identity)` and the `markerHook(ctx, identity)` wrapper. The handler in `forward_handler.go` stashes a `*CPMarker` into the request context (with the request ID, the matched domain-rule UUID, and the hook-outcome input); both the streaming-response and non-streaming-response write paths invoke `markerHook` (which reads back the `*CPMarker` via `CPMarkerFromContext`) before writing the response head.

`identity` is the per-call switch: `compliance-proxy` and `agent` both flow through the same shared infrastructure — same context contract, same `inspect` vs `deny` mode taxonomy, same `PrependChain` / `MergeExposeHeaders` call shape. The only difference is the value stamped on `X-Nexus-Via` (the identity string itself).

When `*CPMarker` is absent (compliance disabled fast-path, or a CONNECT tunnel that never went through the inspector), only `X-Nexus-Via` is stamped — downstream consumers treat the absence of `X-Nexus-Hook` / `X-Nexus-Mode` / `X-Nexus-Domain-Rule` entries as "no inspection ran".

### 6.3 Agent (MITM relay path) — `AgentMarker.injectInto`

`packages/agent/internal/network/proxy/marker.go` exposes `AgentMarker{FlowID, HookOutcome}` and its `injectInto(h)` method, used by the agent's MITM relay before `serializeResponseHead` writes the headers. It prepends `agent` to the via chain, prepends `mitm` to `X-Nexus-Mode` via `PrependChain`, prepends the formatted hook outcome to `X-Nexus-Hook`, and sets `X-Nexus-Request-Id` to the flow ID (the single correlation header — see §1) when non-empty. `MergeExposeHeaders` is called for the relevant marker set.

The MITM relay's synthetic 403 response (`packages/agent/internal/network/proxy/proxy.go`) is built from a literal string template that hardcodes `X-Nexus-Mode: mitm` (and the via, hook, request-id headers). This is the only place in the tree where the value `mitm` appears for the `X-Nexus-Mode` marker — the tlsbump path uses `inspect` / `deny` instead.

## 7. Operations

### Adding a new marker

1. **Define** — add the mixed-case header name to `ExposeHeaders` in `packages/shared/traffic/markers.go`. Update the want-list in `markers_test.go`.
2. **Emit** — pick the right injection mechanic for your service (§6) and write the setter. Set the value as a string; never set an empty string except as a 1:1-alignment placeholder (the AI Gateway `X-Nexus-Mode` reservation is the canonical case).
3. **Document** — add a row to the right §2 sub-table in this doc.

The `markers_test.go` test (`TestExposeHeaders_HasAllMarkers`) is the gate that catches step 1 drift: a marker you set but did not add to the allowlist will show up in browser dev tools as "blocked by CORS"; a marker in the allowlist with no setter is dead-allowlist noise (the case that motivated the 2026-05-25 removal of `x-nexus-upgraded-to`).

### Reading markers client-side

Browser JS (with CORS exposure in place):

```js
const resp = await fetch('https://api.example.com/v1/chat/completions', { ... });
console.log('via:', resp.headers.get('X-Nexus-Via'));
console.log('cache:', resp.headers.get('X-Nexus-Cache'));
console.log('hook chain:', resp.headers.get('X-Nexus-Hook')); // split by "," to align with via
console.log('mode chain:', resp.headers.get('X-Nexus-Mode')); // same alignment; trailing empty position is meaningful
```

Header name lookups are case-insensitive in browsers and in Go; the canonical form on the wire and in the codebase is mixed-case `X-Nexus-*`. A header that the server set but did not expose via CORS returns `null` from `resp.headers.get(...)` in cross-origin requests — the symptom of a server-side allowlist miss.

### Quick debug from a shell

```sh
curl -sI -X POST https://api.example.com/v1/chat/completions \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $VK" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"model":"gpt-4o-mini","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"hi"}]}' \
    | grep -iE '^x-nexus-|^server-timing'
```

The `-iE` flag matches case-insensitively so the canonical mixed-case headers all show up. A `curl -I` (HEAD) is not enough — the gateway code paths that set markers are tied to the POST handler. Use `-X POST` + a real body and grep with the `-i` flag for the marker prefix. Every Nexus-stamped response will show at minimum `X-Nexus-Via` and `X-Nexus-Request-Id`.
