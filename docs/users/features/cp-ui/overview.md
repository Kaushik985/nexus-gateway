# Control Plane UI — Overview section

The OVERVIEW section is the at-a-glance landing surface for administrators. Five sidebar leaves: **Dashboard**, **Traffic**, **Analytics & Metrics**, **Quota Usage**, **Cache ROI**. Sidebar labels and route paths are defined in `packages/control-plane-ui/src/routes/shellRouteConfig.tsx`; labels resolve through `packages/control-plane-ui/src/i18n/locales/en/nav.json`.

## Data freshness and rollups

Four of the five pages — Dashboard, Analytics & Metrics, Quota Usage, and Cache ROI — read from a **pre-aggregated metric rollup pipeline**, not from raw request rows. Only **Traffic** reads individual `traffic_event` rows live; it is the place to look when you need the exact, immediate record of a single request. Understanding the rollup pipeline explains why the aggregate pages can lag a few minutes behind live traffic.

**Granularity.** The finest rollup bucket is **5 minutes**. The Hub runs a cascade of jobs that seal each window in turn: a 5-minute rollup folds raw events into 5-minute buckets, then a 1-hour merge folds 5-minute buckets into hourly buckets, a 1-day merge folds hourly into daily, and a 1-month merge folds daily into calendar-month buckets (UTC). A page picks its bucket size from the selected time span: spans up to 6 hours use 5-minute buckets, up to 90 days use 1-hour, up to 365 days use 1-day, and anything longer uses 1-month.

**Lag.** Each merge step only writes a bucket once that bucket has fully closed, so coarse tables trail real time by their own window length. To keep charts current, queries blend the coarse rollup with the freshest 5-minute tail, so a request that just landed typically appears in the aggregate views within about 5–6 minutes. A daily correction job re-runs the cascade over a 24-hour lookback to fold in events that arrived after their bucket had already sealed. The current calendar month is always excluded from the 1-month view, and latency / error metrics have no 5-minute layer — their finest bucket is 1 hour.

**Staleness signals.** Only **Cache ROI** surfaces an explicit indicator: when the rollup tables hold no rows for the chosen window, the page serves totals directly from raw events, shows a banner, and offers a manual **Trigger Rollup** action. Every other page renders an empty chart ("no data in window") while the pipeline catches up.

## Dashboard

**Purpose.** A single-screen health and business overview of the gateway across a chosen time window.

**What you see.** A hero strip with four KPI stats and a window picker (1h, 1d, 7d, 30d). Below the hero: a **System Health** four-card grid, a conditional **Latency Health** three-card row (when latency data is available), a **Business Snapshot** four-to-five card grid, and a **Top Providers** table.

**Key data.** System Health: combined-requests volume with a VK-vs-proxy split bar, error rate, P95 latency (subtitled with the busiest provider's `us / TTFB / upstream` breakdown), and compliance coverage. Latency Health: own overhead P95, upstream P95, slowest upstream provider. Business Snapshot: total cost, total tokens, active and total providers, cache hit rate, cache savings. Top Providers table columns: provider, requests, average latency, tokens, cost.

**Key actions.** Switch the time window. Click the slowest-provider card to jump to Analytics & Metrics. Click "View all" on Top Providers to jump to Analytics & Metrics.

**Where the data comes from.** Aggregates from the Control Plane admin analytics API: `analyticsApi.summary`, `analyticsApi.byProvider`, `analyticsApi.sparkline`, `analyticsApi.cacheROI`, `analyticsApi.latencyPhases`; provider list from `providerApi.list`; compliance proxy coverage from `proxyApi.getComplianceCoverage` and `proxyApi.getRejectStats`.

## Traffic

**Purpose.** A live event-by-event log of every request handled by any of the three intercept paths, with per-event drill-down.

**What you see.** A page header followed by **source tabs** — `All`, `VK`, `Proxy`, `Agent` — and below the active tab a filter panel, an active-filters chip bar, a paginated data table, and a slide-in event drawer triggered by row click. The selected source is mirrored in the URL via `?source=`.

**Key data.** Each source has its own column set:

- **VK**: time, requested model, routed target, user, organization, project, virtual key, status, latency mini-bar, tokens, derived cost, hook decision, cache hit/miss.
- **Proxy**: time, target host, source IP, method, path, status, latency, bump status, hook decision, compliance tags.
- **Agent**: time, target host, path, device, user, source process, action, status, latency, hook decision, compliance tags.
- **All**: time, source badge, target, method, path, status, latency, hook decision, entity, organization.

**Key actions.** Switch source tab. Open the filter panel for time range and advanced filters; apply, clear, or refresh. Click any row to open the event drawer (full request and response payload, hook trace, downstream timings). Paginate. Deep-link to a single event via `?thingId=`.

**Where the data comes from.** `systemApi.getTrafficStorage` (storage banner state, e.g. file-sink notice), `systemApi.listTrafficEvents` (the table query).

## Analytics & Metrics

**Purpose.** Time-bounded cost, usage, and latency breakdown across configurable group-by axes, with multi-tab depth for charts and rollups.

**What you see.** A page header, a page-level filter card (time range, group-by axis, source button group of `All / VK / Proxy / Agent`), and an inner tab group: **Analytics**, **Latency**, **Metrics**.

**Key data.** The **Analytics** tab shows KPI stat cards (total requests, total cost, total tokens, average latency, cache hit rate, cache net savings), a cost-by-axis pie (top-N plus "Other"), a token-usage stacked bar (prompt and completion), and a breakdown table with per-row search and CSV export (requests, tokens, cost, cache hit rate, cache savings). The **Latency** tab shows the `LatencyPhasesPanel` — own-overhead / TTFB / upstream-body split. The **Metrics** tab embeds the rollup explorer (`MetricsRollupsSection`) with KPI cards, a system-overview chart set, and per-provider grids including a latency-phase stacked area.

**Key actions.** Select time range (24h, 7d, 30d, custom). Select group-by axis (`provider`, `model`, `user`, `organization`, `virtual_key`, `host`, `device`, `project` — the available axes filter by the chosen source). Toggle the source filter. Switch tab. Search and export CSV from the breakdown table.

**Where the data comes from.** `analyticsApi.summary`, `analyticsApi.cost`, `analyticsApi.usage`, `analyticsApi.cacheROI`, and `analyticsApi.metricsAggregates` (for the embedded Metrics tab).

## Quota Usage

**Purpose.** Show quota burn (spend versus configured limit) for a chosen entity scope and period, plus a top-consumers table.

**What you see.** A page header followed by two select filters, an **Overview** data table card, and a **Top Consumers** data table card.

**Key data.** Overview table columns: entity name, entity type, cost limit USD, current cost USD, usage percentage (progress bar coloured by alert level), and alert-level badge (`normal`, `warning`, `critical`). Top Consumers table columns: entity name, entity type, total cost USD.

**Key actions.** Pick the **period** (`monthly` or `weekly`) and the **scope** — the entity axis the burn is measured against (`user`, `project`, or `vk`).

**Where the data comes from.** `quotaAnalyticsApi.overview` and `quotaAnalyticsApi.top`.

## Cache ROI

**Purpose.** Quantify cache savings — both the gateway response cache and provider-native prompt cache — over a chosen window, with daily trend and per-adapter breakdown.

**What you see.** A page header with inline range buttons (7d, 30d, 90d), an optional rollup-not-ready banner that surfaces a "Trigger Rollup" action when the data source is the live store, a hero grid of four summary cards, a **Gateway Cache** section block (two cards), a **Provider Prompt Cache** section block (up to nine cards), a daily-savings line chart, and a per-adapter breakdown table.

**Key data.** Hero: combined savings (USD), savings rate (%), ROI multiplier (×), average savings per hit (USD). Gateway Cache section: gateway savings (USD), gateway cache hits. Provider Prompt Cache section: net savings, read savings, write cost, cache hits, read tokens, creation tokens, read multiplier, strip count, markers injected. Daily line chart series: gateway savings, read savings, write cost, net savings, total net. Adapter table: input and output tokens, gateway hits and savings, prompt-cache net savings / read savings / write cost / hits / read tokens / creation tokens, per-adapter savings rate.

**Key actions.** Switch the range. When the page is reading from the live data source (no recent rollup), click **Trigger Rollup** to fire the four cache-related rollup jobs through `hubApi.triggerJob`; the page auto-refetches after a short delay.

**Where the data comes from.** `analyticsApi.cacheROI`. The rollup trigger goes through `hubApi.triggerJob`.
