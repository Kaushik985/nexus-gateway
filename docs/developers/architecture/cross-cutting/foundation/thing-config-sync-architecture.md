# Thing config sync architecture

## §1 — Scope

This document covers the **end-to-end flow** of a config change: from the admin click in the Control Plane UI to the moment a target Thing's `OnConfigChanged` callback has applied the new state and Hub has recorded the report. The **data model** (Thing entity, shadow columns, `thing_config_template` / `thing_config_override` cascade, Type A vs Type B configKey semantics, three-channel transport, callback contract) lives in `foundation/thing-model.md` — this doc links there rather than redefining.

A02 (this doc) is the **sequence**; A01 (`thing-model.md`) is the **state**.

What's specifically covered here:
- The 5-stage canonical write→push→apply→report→ack flow.
- Per-stage code anchors: CP admin handler → CP `hubclient.NotifyConfigChange` → Hub `manager.Manager.UpdateConfig` → Hub `pool.Broadcast` / NATS `nexus.hub.signal` → Thing-side `configloader.Loader` → Hub `manager.HandleShadowReport`.
- The **two distinct write paths** (template vs override) and how they differ in fanout semantics.
- Cross-Hub fanout via the `nexus.hub.signal` NATS subject + source-Hub skip rule.
- The agent's per-key HTTP pull subpath (`/api/internal/things/config/<key>?type=agent`) that backs Type B keys, including the three-step dispatch inside Hub's `SingleConfigPull`.
- HTTP fallback (`/api/internal/things/heartbeat` + `/api/internal/things/config`) for Things whose WebSocket is down.
- Hub-self consumption via PostgreSQL LISTEN/NOTIFY (`selfshadow.Manager`).
- Admin "Re-sync this key" replays via the `Force` flag.
- Drift detection + recovery + retry-on-apply-failure invariants.

## §2 — Canonical write→apply→report flow

Five stages, end-to-end. Per-key Type A (config blob is the state) and Type B (invalidation signal — state lives in a dedicated table) are explicitly different in stages 3 and 4 (see §4 and §6).

1. **Admin → CP admin handler**. The CP UI submits to an admin endpoint (e.g. `/api/admin/...` for the specific surface). The handler validates the payload, checks the override blacklist when applicable (`packages/shared/schemas/configtypes/policy/override_policy.go` `IsOverridable`), and stamps an audit row.
2. **CP → Hub via `hubclient.NotifyConfigChange`**. CP packages a `ConfigChangeRequest{ThingType, ConfigKey, State, Action, ActorID, ActorName, SourceIP}` and POSTs to Hub with Bearer service-token auth (`INTERNAL_SERVICE_TOKEN`). The client retries up to 3 times with exponential backoff on transient errors. The 4 server Things and the agent never call this — only CP does. Source: `packages/control-plane/internal/platform/hub/client.go` `Client.NotifyConfigChange`.
3. **Hub `manager.Manager.UpdateConfig`** runs the 6-step write (template path) inside a single `pgx.Tx`:
   - Step 0: `AcquireConfigVersionLock` takes a transaction-scoped advisory lock keyed by Thing type (`pg_advisory_xact_lock(hashtextextended(type, 0))`) as the **first** statement of the tx. This serializes per-type `desired_ver` allocation: without it, two concurrent same-type writers both read the same `MAX(desired_ver)` and — because Postgres' `EvalPlanQual` re-applies the `UPDATE` SET clause but does not recompute the CTE scalar — land the **same** `desired_ver`, making the second `config_changed` a silent client-side no-op (`DesiredVer <= reportedVer`) that drops a key until a process restart. The same lock is taken by the override write/clear path so a per-Thing override and a concurrent type-wide update cannot collide either. Acquiring it before any row lock keeps the lock-acquisition order consistent across both paths (no deadlock).
   - Step 1: `UpsertConfigTemplate` bumps `thing_config_template.version`.
   - Step 2: `UpdateDesiredForType` `jsonb_set`s the new state into `thing.desired` for **every Thing of the type at once**, sets `desired_ver` to `COALESCE(MAX(desired_ver), 0)+1` (per-type monotonic — serialized by the Step 0 lock so concurrent same-type writers get distinct, consecutive versions), and emits `pg_notify(config_changed, thingID)` for every affected row.
   - Step 4: `InsertConfigChangeEvent` writes the audit row.
   - Tx commit. Then post-commit best-effort:
   - Step 3: Redis cache the desired key (`nexus:desired:<type>:<configKey>`).
   - Step 5: `broadcastConfigChanged` builds a `ConfigChangedMessage` and calls `pool.Broadcast(thingType, ...)`.
   - Step 6: `publishHubSignal` marshals a `HubSignal` envelope and `mq.Publish` it to NATS subject `nexus.hub.signal`.
   - Source: `packages/nexus-hub/internal/fleet/manager/config.go` `UpdateConfig`.
4. **Hub → Thing push** happens via two parallel channels:
   - **Local WebSocket**: every Thing of the matching type currently connected to *this* Hub replica gets the frame (`pool.Broadcast`).
   - **Cross-Hub NATS**: peer Hub replicas receive the `nexus.hub.signal` and broadcast onto their own local pools (see §3).
5. **Thing applies + reports**. The Thing's `OnConfigChanged` callback (registered through `configloader.Loader.Handler()`) decides Type A or Type B per key (§4), applies, and emits `shadow_report` over WS. **Per-key dispatch (F-0120/F-0122)**: a `config_changed` delta carries one key, and the thingclient re-applies and reports **only that key** (`mergeDelta` records the key into the full `desiredCache` but hands the callback a single-key map); full-map apply is reserved for the connect snapshot and the retry re-apply (§11). Hub's `manager.HandleShadowReport` **merges** the reported key(s) into `thing.reported` / `thing.reported_outcomes` per-key (jsonb `||`, version-guarded — §11) and bumps `thing.reported_ver`, then acks. The admin UI's Nodes / Configuration tab then renders the convergence (drift cleared, version equal).

## §3 — Cross-Hub fanout (NATS `nexus.hub.signal`)

Hub runs as multiple replicas in production. A config write hits exactly one replica (whichever CP's HTTP client load-balances to). For Things connected to other replicas, the write Hub fans out via the NATS subject `nexus.hub.signal`.

**Subject + envelope**:
- Subject: `nexus.hub.signal` (single subject for all config signals).
- Envelope: `manager.HubSignal{Action, SourceHub, ThingType, ConfigKey, State, Version, ThingID, Force}`. `Action` is currently always `"config_changed"`. `ThingID` empty means "broadcast to all Things of `ThingType`"; non-empty targets a single Thing (used by admin replay — §7).
- Source: `packages/nexus-hub/internal/fleet/manager/config.go` `HubSignal`.

**Subscriber**: every Hub replica runs `ws.SubscribeHubSignals` (`packages/nexus-hub/internal/ws/signal.go`). On receipt:
- **Source-Hub skip**: `if sig.SourceHub == hubID { return nil }`. The originating Hub deliberately doesn't re-process its own publish; it already pushed locally via `pool.Broadcast` in step 5 of `UpdateConfig`.
- Build a `ConfigChangedMessage` from the signal.
- Route to local pool: `pool.Send(thingID, ...)` if `ThingID` is set, else `pool.Broadcast(thingType, ...)`.

**Failure mode**: NATS publish is best-effort (`m.logger.Warn("publish hub signal failed", "error", err)` on error). A NATS outage means peer Hubs don't see the new config until the affected Things' next reconnect or HTTP-fallback heartbeat poll (§6).

## §4 — Frames on the wire

Two structs cover all Hub→Thing config push traffic.

**`ConnectedMessage`** (sent on every successful WS handshake, before `Run` begins):
- Source: `packages/nexus-hub/internal/ws/server.go` (struct sent at `ws.handleConnect`).
- Fields: `Type` (= `"connected"`), `HubID`, `Desired map[string]any` (full per-key snapshot, value is `{state, version}`), `DesiredVer`.
- Built from `manager.RegisterThing`'s `RegisterResponse{Desired, DesiredVer}`.
- This is the **full-snapshot apply** the thingclient relies on at reconnect (`packages/shared/transport/thingclient/client.go` `connectWS`).

**`ConfigChangedMessage`** (per-key delta, sent both by local broadcast and by NATS subscriber relay):
- Source: `packages/nexus-hub/internal/fleet/manager/config.go` `ConfigChangedMessage`.
- Fields: `Type` (= `"config_changed"`), `ConfigKey`, `State json.RawMessage`, `DesiredVer`, `Force bool` (omitempty).
- **No `Desired` full-map field** — `config_changed` is strictly per-key delta. Full snapshots only travel on the "connected" frame. The thingclient receiver enforces this symmetrically: `handleHubMessage`'s `config_changed` branch has exactly two outcomes — a per-key apply+report when `ConfigKey` is set, or a warn-and-drop when it is empty. There is no full-map fallback arm. On the apply path the changed key is recorded into the full `desiredCache` but **only that key is dispatched to the callback and reported** (F-0122) — the Hub-side per-key reported merge (§11) is what lets a single-key report land without clobbering siblings.
- `Force=true` is set exclusively by admin re-sync replays (§7).

## §5 — Template write vs override write

Both paths land in the same `OnConfigChanged` callback on the Thing side, but they have **different fanout semantics on the Hub side**.

**Template write** (`Manager.UpdateConfig` → `UpdateDesiredForType`):
- Affects: every Thing of one `ThingType` simultaneously (the new state is `jsonb_set`'d into every `thing` row of that type).
- pg_notify: one NOTIFY per affected row.
- Post-commit fanout: WS `pool.Broadcast(thingType, ...)` + NATS `publishHubSignal` (so peer Hubs reach their own Things).
- Cross-Hub coverage: ✓ — Things on any Hub replica get the change promptly.

**Override write** (`Manager.SetOverride` / `ClearOverride`):
- Affects: a single Thing (per-Thing whole-key replacement, computed by re-merging templates ⊕ override).
- Tx body: `UpsertOverride` (or `DeleteOverride`) + `recomputeDesiredTx` + `WriteDesiredAndBumpVer` + `insertAdminAuditLog`. `WriteDesiredAndBumpVer` emits one pg_notify for that thing's ID inside the Tx.
- Post-commit fanout: **`m.RePushConfigKey(thingID, configKey)`** runs at the end of both `SetOverride` and `ClearOverride` (`packages/nexus-hub/internal/fleet/manager/override.go`). `RePushConfigKey` is the same single-Thing push helper §10 uses for admin "Re-sync this key" replays: WS-local first (`m.ws.Send(thingID, ...)`), NATS fallback (`HubSignal{ThingID: thingID, ...}`) when the Thing is connected to a peer Hub. The override push always sets `Force=true` so the Thing's `applyConfig` short-circuit doesn't drop a change at the same `DesiredVer`.
- Cross-Hub coverage: ✓ — overrides reach the target Thing on the same single-Thing fanout path as admin re-sync replays, regardless of which Hub holds the WS connection.
- Push failure (`ErrNoDeliveryPath` or NATS publish error) is logged at WARN as `override_push_failed` but does **not** roll back the override write. The drift detection job (§11) re-converges any Thing whose `reported_ver` lags behind `desired_ver`.

In short: **override has full push semantics identical to template fanout**, plus `Force=true` so the receiver always re-applies + re-reports. The pg_notify on `config_changed` exists as the Hub-self LISTEN trigger (§9) but is **not** the propagation mechanism for the target Thing.

## §6 — Thing-side apply via `configloader.Loader`

Every Thing wires its receivers through `packages/shared/transport/configloader/configloader.go`. The Loader owns the dispatch table, the typed-or-raw decoding, and the `needsPull` HTTP-fetch escape hatch. Each service's `cmd/<svc>/configdispatch/` builds its Loader from per-key applier closures and then installs `tc.OnConfigChanged(l.Handler())`.

Three registration APIs:
- **`Register[V any]`** — generic, auto-unmarshal into `V`. Used for typed Type A keys.
- **`RegisterRaw`** — raw `[]byte` apply closure. Used when the receiver wants to control decoding.
- **`RegisterRawPull`** — raw `[]byte` apply, but the key is flagged Cat B: the WS shadow tick is treated as a signal only and its desired bytes are discarded. The Loader calls an external puller closure (HTTP fetch) to get the real bytes before invoking the apply. The pull is driven by this registration-time flag — `needsPull` is a client-side concept in the Loader, NOT a field Hub stamps into the pushed state; the Loader never inspects the pushed bytes for a `{needsPull: true}` marker. Currently only used by the agent (§7).

`Loader.Handler()` returns a function compatible with `thingclient.Client.OnConfigChanged`. The thingclient invariants from A01 §7 (`applyConfig`'s no-callback skip, version-equality skip, partial-report-on-error) apply identically. `Loader.Apply` is continue-on-error: it attempts every key, records each outcome on the `OutcomeTracker`, and returns `(partialReported, firstErr)`; `applyConfig` forwards that partial report (with the per-key outcomes ledger) to Hub even when `firstErr != nil` so a single bad key does not blank the node's per-key detail.

Per-service wiring sites:
- AI Gateway: `packages/ai-gateway/cmd/ai-gateway/configdispatch/configdispatch.go`.
- Control Plane: `packages/control-plane/cmd/control-plane/configdispatch/`.
- Compliance Proxy: `packages/compliance-proxy/cmd/compliance-proxy/configdispatch/`.
- Agent: `packages/agent/cmd/agent/configdispatch.go` (plus `configappliers.go` for the per-key apply functions).

**`streaming_compliance` handler pattern (agent + compliance-proxy, NOT ai-gateway)**: agent and compliance-proxy register a configdispatch applier that routes the raw payload directly through `streampolicy.Store.ApplyShadowState(ctx, raw)`. The Store is hot-swappable; SSE-hot-path readers call `Store.Get()` and atomically see the new policy. **ai-gateway does not register a `streaming_compliance` applier** — the key is absent from `ValidByThingType["ai-gateway"]`, so Hub never pushes it to the gateway. ai-gateway's `streampolicy.Store` is seeded at boot from `system_metadata` and is treated as boot-time-only configuration. See [sse-streaming-compliance-architecture.md](../safety/sse-streaming-compliance-architecture.md) §Hub-push alignment.

**`credentials` shadow applier (ai-gateway)**: on a `credentials` push, the applier parses a targeted-invalidation envelope and calls `CredManager.Invalidate(id)` for each changed credential ID. When the push carries no targeted IDs (e.g. a full-reload signal), it falls back to `CredManager.ClearCache()`. This avoids the prior behaviour of wiping the entire decrypted-credential cache on every `credentials` shadow event.

## §7 — Agent HTTP-pull subpath

The agent is the only Thing that uses `RegisterRawPull`. For each Cat B key (the agent set: `exemptions`, `hooks`, `interception_domains`, `payload_capture`, `streaming_compliance`, `installed_rule_packs`, `user_context`), Hub pushes minimal state bytes over WS as a signal; the Loader discards them and calls the HTTP puller closure to fetch the full payload before applying. (`killswitch` is Cat A — registered via the non-pull `RegisterRaw` path with full bytes pushed inline.) The pull is triggered by the `RegisterRawPull` flag on the client, not by any marker in the pushed payload.

**Puller URL** (`packages/agent/cmd/agent/configdispatch.go` `agentPullConfig`):

    GET https://<hub>/api/internal/things/config/<configKey>?type=agent

With `Authorization: Bearer <deviceToken>` and `X-Thing-Id: <thingID>` headers.

**Hub-side handler** (`packages/nexus-hub/internal/fleet/handler/hubapi/internal_things.go` `SingleConfigPull`) — two-branch dispatch:
- **Cat B loader path**: if `(thingType, configKey)` has a registered Cat B loader (`CatBRegistry`), invoke `loader.Load(ctx, thingID)` and return `{configKey, state, version, source: "loader"}`. Loaders aggregate the authoritative payload from CP-owned business tables (e.g. `HookConfig`, `compliance_exemption_grant`); they read DB rows that CP writes, so the agent gets the live CP-side state.
- **Template fallback**: no loader registered → `GetConfigTemplate(thingType, configKey)` and return `{configKey, state, version, source: "template"}`. This covers Cat A inline keys and Hub instances that haven't wired the Cat B registry.

**Loader inventory** (`packages/nexus-hub/internal/compliance/catbagent/`, one file per agent Cat B key): `exemptions.go`, `hook_config.go`, `installed_rule_packs.go`, `interception_domains.go`, `payload_capture.go`, `streaming_compliance.go`, `user_context.go`. Wired into the storage layer at `packages/nexus-hub/cmd/nexus-hub/wiring/storage.go`.

**Why agent doesn't read PostgreSQL directly**: the agent never holds DB credentials and never has a DB route. Every byte of agent state comes from Hub over HTTP.

## §8 — HTTP fallback (server-side Things)

When a server Thing's WebSocket is down, it falls back to HTTP polling. Source: `packages/shared/transport/thingclient/http.go`.

- **Heartbeat**: `POST /api/internal/things/heartbeat` carries `heartbeatRequest{id, status:"online", reportedVer}`. Hub returns `heartbeatResponse{ack, desiredVer, desired (optional map)}`. The Thing compares its `reportedVer` against the returned `desiredVer`; mismatch triggers a config pull.
- **Config pull**: `GET /api/internal/things/config?type=<thingType>&id=<thingID>` (`BulkConfigPull` on Hub). Returns `{configs: {key: {state, version}}, desiredVer}`. Critically, when `id` is supplied, per-key `version` = the Thing's `thing.desired_ver` (per-type monotonic) — so the same comparison the WS path uses still works.
- **Shadow report**: `POST /api/internal/things/shadow` carries the same `{reported, reportedVer, reportedOutcomes}` payload as the WS `shadow_report` frame — byte-for-byte compatible parsing on Hub, and the same Hub-side per-key merge (§11).
- **Live credential (F-0351)**: both transports read the Bearer token through `Client.currentToken()` at the moment of use — the WS handshake on every dial/reconnect, the HTTP client on every request. When `Config.TokenFn` is set it is authoritative (falling back to the static `Config.Token` only when nil or empty), so a credential rotated after `Start` (the agent's device-token renewal) is picked up on the next connection/request without restarting the client. Callers that never rotate leave `TokenFn` nil for unchanged behavior.

Prometheus counter `httpFallbackReqs{type=...}` tracks each kind (`register`, `heartbeat`, `shadow`, `config_pull`).

**Cross-Thing identity binding (HTTP fallback).** All `/api/internal/things/*` HTTP endpoints are gated by `DeviceOrServiceAuth`, which authenticates a device-token caller against its `X-Thing-Id` and attaches the validated `*store.Thing` to the request context. Every handler that operates on a thing id taken from the request body or query (`register`, `heartbeat`, `shadow`, `config?id=`, `deregister`, `:id/attestation-pubkey`, plus `audit`, `exemption`) enforces, via `requireThingMatch`, that a device-token caller's operated id equals its authenticated id — a device token cannot act on another Thing's row. Service-token callers (CP / Hub-internal) have no context Thing and bypass the check. This mirrors the WebSocket path, which already derives the acting identity from the validated connection rather than the frame payload. (The `renew-cert` handler was removed when Hub-issued P-256 mTLS device certificates were deprecated; agents now self-sign their device identity.)

## §9 — Hub-self special path (`selfshadow.Manager`)

Hub itself is a `Thing` (one row in `thing` for each Hub replica's `instanceID`). It does not run a WebSocket client pointed at itself; it *is* the broker. Instead, Hub consumes its own row via PostgreSQL LISTEN/NOTIFY.

- **Channel**: `config_changed` (constant defined in `packages/nexus-hub/internal/fleet/shadow/shadow_notify.go` `ConfigChangedChannel`).
- **Emitter**: every Hub write that mutates `thing.desired` calls `notifyConfigChanged(tx, thingID)` inside the same `pgx.Tx`. This applies to both `UpdateDesiredForType` (template path) and `WriteDesiredAndBumpVer` (override path). pg_notify is delivered only on commit, so rollback discards.
- **Consumer**: `packages/nexus-hub/internal/self/shadow/manager.go` `Manager`. Each Hub replica runs one. It LISTENs, parses the payload (which is just the `thingID`), and filters to act only when `thingID == m.instanceID` — i.e. **only when the changed Thing is this Hub's own row**.
- **Dispatch**: matching notifications trigger registered `ReloadHandler`s. Outcomes mirror thingclient: `recordOutcome(key, ver, err)` tracks the last successful `appliedAt`/`appliedVersion` per key and the most recent error.

The pg_notify channel is therefore a *Hub-internal* mechanism. It does **not** push other Things' updates — those go through WS broadcast + NATS as described in §3 and §5.

## §10 — Force-resync admin replay

Admins can re-push the current desired config to a single Thing even when nothing has changed — useful for recovering a drifted `thing.reported`.

- **Entry point**: CP admin endpoint → Hub `manager.Manager.ForceResyncKey(thingID, configKey)` (single key) or `ForceResyncAll(thingID)` (every key). Source: `packages/nexus-hub/internal/fleet/manager/drift.go`.
- **Version bump (delivery guarantee)**: a force-resync first re-stamps the Thing's `desired_ver` (rewriting the current desired map unchanged) inside a transaction that takes `AcquireConfigVersionLock` (A01 §9 / F-0109), then does the immediate push. The bump is what makes the resync converge on an **HTTP-fallback Thing**: such a Thing is on no Hub's WS pool, so the WS/NATS push below cannot reach it — only the heartbeat version-compare (`desired_ver != reported_ver`, §8) delivers, and that fires only because the version moved. Without the bump, a force-resync of an in-sync HTTP-fallback Thing was a silent no-op that still reported success (F-0116). The override / break-glass post-commit path uses the lower-level `RePushConfigKey` instead, which does **not** bump — those flows already bumped `desired_ver` inside their own transaction, so the heartbeat pull is already armed.
- **Immediate push** (also covers cross-Hub): after the bump, each key is pushed best-effort via `rePushConfigKeyForThing`, which builds a `ConfigChangedMessage` with `Force: true`:
  - If the target Thing is locally connected (`m.ws.IsConnected(thingID)` and `m.ws.Send(thingID, ...)` succeeds), deliver over WS directly.
  - Else publish a `HubSignal{Action: "config_changed", ThingID, Force: true, ...}` to `nexus.hub.signal` so the peer Hub that holds the WS connection can deliver.
  - A `ErrNoDeliveryPath` here is **not** a failure: the version bump already guarantees the heartbeat pull delivers, so the key is counted as pushed.
- **Thing-side effect**: with `Force=true` on the wire, `applyConfig`'s `desiredVer <= reportedVer` short-circuit (A01 §7) is bypassed. The callback runs and emits a fresh `shadow_report` even at the same version. Without `Force`, an admin replay at the same `DesiredVer` would be silently dropped on the client.

## §11 — Drift detection + recovery

- **Triggers**:
  - HTTP fallback heartbeat returning a `desiredVer` greater than the Thing's `reportedVer` (Thing-driven discovery; §8).
  - Periodic drift job: `packages/nexus-hub/internal/jobs/defs/drift/drift.go`. Two passes. **Version pass** — `FindDriftedThings` scans `WHERE status IN ('online', 'drift')` with `desired_ver != reported_ver` (online **and** already-drift rows, not online-only). It does **not** flip to `drift` on first detection: each drifted Thing first goes through `handleDriftedThing`, which **attempts repair** by re-pushing the desired config (`mgr.RePushConfig`) and increments a per-Thing Redis retry counter (`nexus:drift:retry:<id>`, `driftRetryTTL` 5m); only once `retries > driftMaxRetries` (3) does it mark `status = 'drift'` via `UpdateThingStatus` (with no Redis it always repairs and never marks drift). **Content pass** (F-0112) — `FindEqualVersionOnlineThings` catches version-equal but content-divergent Things and runs the same retry/exhaustion machinery under a separate counter namespace (`nexus:drift:content-retry:`).
- **Auto-recovery**: the next successful `HandleShadowReport` that catches `reported_ver` up to `desired_ver` flips `status` back to `'online'`. The registry update composes the monotonic guard (F-0111) with the per-key merge (F-0120) so a stale / duplicate / older report cannot regress state AND a single-key report cannot clobber siblings: `reported_ver = GREATEST(reported_ver, $3)`; the `reported` / `reported_outcomes` columns are **merged key-by-key** (`COALESCE(reported, '{}') || $2::jsonb`) only when `$3 >= reported_ver` (a stale report is dropped, an empty `{}` report is a no-op merge); and the drift-clear arm keys off the effective version — `CASE WHEN status = 'drift' AND GREATEST(reported_ver, $3) >= desired_ver THEN 'online' ELSE status END` (`packages/nexus-hub/internal/fleet/store/thing_shadow.go`). The HTTP heartbeat (§8) likewise only promotes `offline → online` and never clobbers `drift`/`revoked` (F-0208).
- **Manual recovery**: admin uses the "Re-sync this key" action (§10).
- **CP-side missed-push backstop (Category B)**: the Hub-side drift job above only detects divergence between `desired_ver` and `reported_ver` — it cannot see a write that never reached Hub at all (the CP→Hub push failed during a Hub restart/blip), because in that case Hub never bumped `desired_ver`. For that case the Control Plane keeps its own durable intent ledger (`propagation_ledger:*` rows in `system_metadata`) and its reconcile loop re-pushes any Category-B key whose push it never confirmed; see the Config reconciliation note in [control-plane-architecture.md](../../services/control-plane/control-plane-architecture.md) and the per-key catalog in [configuration-architecture.md](configuration-architecture.md) §6.
- **Apply-failure handling + proactive retry (F-0121/F-0117)**: if the Thing's callback returns an error (A01 §7), or any key from a prior round is still unresolved, the client **still sends a partial `shadow_report`** carrying the keys that did apply plus the per-key `reportedOutcomes` ledger (so the Nodes page shows which key failed and why) and does **not** advance the global `reported_ver` — the node stays out of sync vs `desired_ver`. The failed keys are recorded in an in-memory registry (`Client.failed`) that holds `reported_ver` behind `desired_ver` until **every** key converges (since per-key dispatch no longer re-runs siblings, a clean round cannot falsely advance the version while a sibling is still broken). A **bounded backoff retry timer** then re-attempts the failed keys without waiting for the next push: on fire it re-applies the **full** desired snapshot (so the complete reported map re-lands at the advanced version, which the per-key merge + monotonic guard would otherwise leave a held sibling stale), clears keys that converge, and re-arms with exponential backoff up to `MaxConfigRetryAttempts` (default 8; `RetryInitialBackoff` 2s, `RetryMaxBackoff` 60s). The timer cancels the moment nothing is outstanding; a brand-new failure resets the budget. If the budget is exhausted the keys remain parked in drift for the next reconnect snapshot to re-converge. Auto-recovery (above) fires only once a later report catches `reported_ver` up to `desired_ver`.

## §12 — Status state machine writers

`thing.status` ∈ `{enrolled, online, offline, drift, revoked}`. Each value is written by a specific code path:

- `enrolled` — default at insert (`tools/db-migrate/schema/nodes.prisma` `Thing.status` default).
- `online` — written by five paths, not one:
  - **First-time enrollment** — `UpsertThingEnrollmentWithDesiredVer` with `Status: "online"`. `manager.RegisterThing` reaches this **only** on the `ErrNotFound` branch (the row does not yet exist); `selfreg.Manager` enrolls Hub's own row at boot the same way. It is *not* the steady-state path — a reconnecting Thing already has a row, so it never re-runs this upsert.
  - **Reconnect / re-register** — `authstore.TouchThingSession` (`packages/nexus-hub/internal/identity/store/authstore/session.go`), called first by `RegisterThing`; it sets `status = 'online'` unconditionally and, when the prior status was not `online`, stamps `process_started_at = NOW()` + clears `reported_outcomes`. This is the common WS-connect online-writer.
  - **WS liveness refresh** — `RefreshLiveness` (driven by the WS ping loop) promotes `offline → online` only, never clobbering `drift`/`revoked`.
  - **HTTP fallback heartbeat** — `Store.Heartbeat` (§8) mirrors `RefreshLiveness`: `offline → online` only (F-0208 status gate).
  - **Drift clear** — `UpdateShadowReport` flips `drift → online` when a version-guarded report catches `reported_ver` up to `desired_ver` (§11).
- `offline` — two writers:
  - `manager.Manager.MarkOffline` (called from `ws.Server` on WS disconnect, `packages/nexus-hub/internal/fleet/manager/enrichment.go`). The disconnect cleanup gates this on `pool.Remove(conn)` returning `true`: the pool only evicts (and reports `true`) when the disconnecting connection is still the registered one for its Thing ID. On a reconnect race — an ungraceful disconnect lingers while the Thing reconnects and a new connection is installed — the stale connection's late `Remove` returns `false`, so `MarkOffline` is **suppressed**; otherwise a live node would be marked offline and every subsequent `pool.Send` config push would be black-holed. The superseded connection is torn down with `Conn.CloseNow` (no close handshake) so a vanished peer cannot stall the pool lock.
  - `store.MarkStaleOffline` (called from the periodic `jobs/defs/drift/stale_thing` job for Things whose `last_seen_at` exceeds a per-type threshold).
- `drift` — set by `jobs/defs/drift/drift.go` `UpdateThingStatus(thingID, "drift")`, but only **after** repair is exhausted: the job scans `status IN ('online', 'drift')` for a version (or content) mismatch and re-pushes the desired config up to `driftMaxRetries` (3) times (Redis-counted, 5m TTL) before flipping the row to `drift`. See §11 for the retry/repair sequence.
- `revoked` — written by admin-driven revocation flows (out of scope here; covered alongside enrollment in the agent identity & enrollment doc).
