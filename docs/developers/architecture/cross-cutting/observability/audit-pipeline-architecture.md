# Audit pipeline architecture

The audit pipeline is the asynchronous fan-in path that turns every LLM traffic event observed by a data-plane service into a row on the Hub's `traffic_event` table (plus its two sidecars, `traffic_event_payload` and `traffic_event_normalized`). It is the substrate the Traffic drawer, cost dashboards, alerting engine, and the SIEM bridge all read from — a single canonical timeline of every request that touched the gateway, the compliance proxy, or an enrolled agent.

This doc covers **LLM traffic only**. Admin-mutation audit (CP-UI writes, IAM changes, credential rotation) travels on a separate queue and table — see `admin-audit-log-coverage.md`.

The pipeline has three structural pieces: the **producer** in each data-plane service (`audit.Record` → `TrafficEventMessage`), the **MQ stream** (`NEXUS_EVENTS` JetStream stream with InterestPolicy fan-out), and the **consumer** in Hub (`TrafficEventWriter` consumer group `hub-db-writer`). A second consumer group (`hub-siem`) reads the same queues independently — see §10 and `siem-bridge-architecture.md`.

## 1. Anchor packages

- `packages/ai-gateway/internal/platform/audit/` — file layout: `audit.go` (top-level constants + `EndpointType` vocabulary), `enums.go` (cache/hook enums + `DeriveCacheStatus`), `record.go` (`Record` struct + `ApplyVKMeta` + helpers), `writer.go` (`Writer` lifecycle + `Enqueue` + flush + close), `message.go` (`recordToMessage`), `storage_action.go` (`applyStorageAction`), `coerce.go` (authoritative chat-field zeroing for embedding rows).
- `packages/ai-gateway/internal/ingress/proxy/proxy.go` — the `ServeProxy` handler that allocates the `Record`, hands it to a centralized defer that snapshots phase timings and enqueues, and finalizes latency with ceiling-millisecond rounding.
- `packages/ai-gateway/cmd/ai-gateway/wiring/aiguard.go` — second producer site: ai-guard classify calls emit their own audit row through the same `Writer`.
- `packages/compliance-proxy/internal/audit/` and `packages/compliance-proxy/cmd/compliance-proxy/wiring/audit.go` — compliance-proxy producer, writes to `nexus.event.compliance`.
- `packages/nexus-hub/internal/traffic/ingest/audit/agent_audit.go` — Hub-side ingest of the agent's HTTP-uploaded audit batches, re-published to `nexus.event.agent` so the same consumer can pick them up.
- `packages/shared/transport/mq/messages.go` — `TrafficEventMessage` wire envelope (producer view).
- `packages/shared/transport/mq/streams.go` — `EnsureStreams` for the `NEXUS_EVENTS` JetStream stream.
- `packages/nexus-hub/internal/observability/consumer/traffic.go` — `TrafficEventWriter`: per-queue consume goroutines, `BatchAccumulator`, three-phase insert (`traffic_event` → `traffic_event_payload` → `traffic_event_normalized`), poison-pill ack policy, ack/nak.
- `packages/nexus-hub/internal/observability/consumer/message.go` — consumer-side `TrafficEventMessage` with pointer-typed nullable columns.
- `packages/nexus-hub/internal/observability/consumer/batch.go` — generic batch accumulator (size + interval flush).
- `packages/nexus-hub/internal/observability/consumer/manager.go` — orchestrates `TrafficEventWriter` + `AdminAuditWriter` + `SIEMForwarder`, exposes the `nexus_consumer_healthy` gauge.
- `packages/nexus-hub/internal/observability/consumer/siem.go` — second consumer group on the same queues, with admin-audit added.
- `tools/db-migrate/schema.prisma` — `traffic_event`, `traffic_event_payload`, and `traffic_event_normalized` models.
- `packages/shared/policy/payloadcapture/` — runtime caps on captured body bytes and the inline-vs-spill threshold.

```

The agent never publishes to MQ directly. It uploads audit batches over HTTP to a Hub admin endpoint that converts each event into the same envelope shape and re-publishes to `nexus.event.agent`, so the consumer path is identical for all three sources.

A second consumer group, `hub-siem`, attaches to the same three traffic queues plus `nexus.event.admin-audit` and forwards events to an external SIEM sink. The two groups are independent — JetStream's `InterestPolicy` retains messages until **every** registered consumer group acks, so a stalled SIEM forwarder cannot mask a stalled db-writer (or vice-versa).

## 3. Producer side — `audit.Record` and the central defer

`audit.Record` is the in-process struct each data-plane service mutates throughout request handling. It is allocated in the ingress handler immediately after the request is parsed enough to know its `RequestID`, `TraceID`, `Method`, `Path`, `IngressFormat`, and `EndpointType`, and a `defer` is registered on the same line:

- The defer reads the upstream `PhaseSink` populated by the singleton tracing transport (`UpstreamTtfbMs`, `UpstreamTotalMs`), snapshots the per-request `PhaseTimer` (`auth_ms`, `quota_ms`, `routing_ms`, `cache_lookup_ms`, `req_adapter_ms`, `resp_adapter_ms`), computes `upstream_body_ms` from the TTFB / total gap, computes `audit_emit_ms` for the time spent in the defer up to the hand-off, finalizes `LatencyMs` with **ceiling-millisecond rounding** (so a sub-millisecond cache hit reports as `1` instead of `0`, which the wire format would have treated as "field absent"), and only then calls `h.deps.AuditWriter.Enqueue(rec)`.
- Latency rounding lives in `proxy.go`'s defer **and** in `finalize()` because a handful of failure paths return before the defer can finish snapshot computation; both sites round identically.
- A `LatencyDetail` operator flag widens the snapshot to surface sub-ms phases as `1`, used during perf investigations. The default keeps prod rows compact.

The same `Writer` is shared by the ai-gateway proxy handler and by ai-guard's classify call — each classify emits a self-audit row tagged `InternalPurpose = "ai-guard"` so the admin UI can hide ai-guard rows from customer billing views by default.

`Record` carries every field that lands on `traffic_event` plus a handful of in-proc-only conveniences (per-hook `HooksPipeline` slice, `RequestTransformSpans` / `ResponseTransformSpans` for the storage-action pass, `RequestRedactRuleIDs` / `ResponseRedactRuleIDs` for the drop-content placeholder). The conversion to the wire envelope happens later, in `recordToMessage`, so the producer is free to keep richer in-proc types.

## 4. Writer — buffering, batching, retry, shutdown

The `Writer` (`audit.NewWriter`) owns the in-memory buffer and the background flush goroutine:

- `defaultBatchSize = 100`, `defaultFlushInterval = 5s`, `maxQueueSize = 10000`. Tunables are package constants, not yaml — there is one audit pipeline per process and operators do not configure it.
- `Enqueue` is **non-blocking**. When `len(buf) >= maxQueueSize` the record is dropped, a warning is logged with the `requestId`, and `nexus_audit_mq_dropped_total` is incremented. Dropping under sustained back-pressure is preferred over blocking the request path.
- Embedding rows are coerced inside `audit.Writer.Enqueue`. When `EndpointType == EndpointTypeEmbeddings`, `coerceEmbeddingRow` (`packages/ai-gateway/internal/platform/audit/coerce.go`) zeroes chat-only fields (`completion_tokens`, `cache_read_tokens`, `cache_creation_tokens`, `reasoning_tokens`, `reasoning_cost_usd`) and emits a per-field warning naming the field, value, and request id. Every producer that publishes audit rows — proxy live response, proxy cache hits, and the ai-guard `WriterBackedTrafficSink` — emits through this single Enqueue path, so the coerce runs uniformly without each producer site re-implementing the rule.
- `flushLoop` ticks on `defaultFlushInterval`, snapshots the buffer under a mutex, marshals each record via `recordToMessage`, and calls `producer.Enqueue(ctx, queue, data)` with a per-record 5-second timeout.
- On a producer.Enqueue failure the record is **re-buffered** as long as space remains (`nexus_audit_mq_enqueue_errors_total` increments); if the buffer is at the cap the record is counted on `nexus_audit_mq_dropped_total` instead. There is no per-record back-off — the next flush tick is the retry.
- `Close()` drains the buffer through `drainBuffer` with a 15-second wall-time deadline and 200ms backoff between flush attempts. Records still in the buffer at the deadline are counted on `nexus_audit_mq_dropped_total` and logged so a sustained MQ outage at shutdown surfaces in monitoring instead of disappearing silently.
- `WithThingIdentity(id, name)` stamps `ThingID` / `ThingName` onto every envelope so the consumer can attribute the row to the emitting Thing instance (gateway pod, proxy pod, agent host). Identity is set once at startup before any flush runs.
- `WithSpillStore(store)` wires the out-of-band body backend; `WithPayloadCaptureStore(s)` wires the runtime cap snapshot so admin shadow updates take effect on the next flush without a restart; `WithNormalizer(fn)` wires the normalize closure that produces the `traffic_event_normalized` sidecar bytes.

`recordToMessage` is where the in-proc `Record` is reshaped into the wire envelope. It dispatches identity by VK type (personal → user, application → project, anything else → empty entity), derives the unified `CacheStatus` from the four detail fields via `DeriveCacheStatus` (unless the producer already set it), aggregates per-hook latency into `RequestHooksMs` / `ResponseHooksMs` if the proxy handler did not stamp them explicitly, and stamps `NormalizeVersion` to keep the persisted normalized blob versionable per row.

## 5. Storage actions — `applyStorageAction`

After `recordToMessage` produces the marshalled `NormalizedPayload` bytes for each direction, `applyStorageAction` rewrites them per the operator's `onMatch.storageAction` (the storage half of the two-axis PII policy — see `pii-redaction-policy-architecture.md`):

- `keep` / `""` / nil → no change. The raw normalized JSON lands on `traffic_event_normalized.request_normalized` or `.response_normalized` verbatim.
- `redact` → `normcore.ApplySpans(payload, spans)` is invoked with the same `TransformSpan` set the hook pipeline emitted, then the result is re-marshalled. Empty spans short-circuit and the raw bytes are kept.
- `drop-content` → the persisted blob is replaced with a minimal placeholder `{redacted: true, kind, normalizeVersion, protocol, ruleIds}`. The original normalized bytes never reach the wire.

Failures (unmarshal error, marshal error) fall back to the original bytes — the storage policy is observability, not a runtime gate. The runtime body forwarded upstream is governed independently by the hook pipeline's **inflight** axis; the two axes can diverge (e.g., redact upstream, drop-content in audit storage) and the resulting divergence is recorded via a standard `ReasonCode` on the audit row itself.

`applyStorageAction` runs only on the **normalized** sidecar bytes. The raw captured bytes on `traffic_event_payload.inline_request_body` / `inline_response_body` are NOT rewritten by this function — they are bounded only by the payload-capture cap (§7) and are subject to the same null-byte stripping the consumer applies to every text field before insert.

A skip exists for the response direction when the effective passthrough config has `bypassNormalize=true`: the request-side normalize still runs (it happens before passthrough is resolved, and the result helps incident triage), but the response-side normalize emission is suppressed so the audit row faithfully reflects "we did not normalize the response on this row".

## 6. MQ wire envelope — `TrafficEventMessage`

`TrafficEventMessage` is the canonical wire shape for traffic events on MQ. All three producers (ai-gateway, compliance-proxy, agent-via-Hub) serialize into the same struct; the consumer-side struct in `packages/nexus-hub/internal/observability/consumer/message.go` mirrors it field-for-field but uses pointer types for every nullable DB column so absent JSON fields land as SQL `NULL` instead of zero values.

Notable wire decisions:

- `LatencyMs` is intentionally emitted **without** `omitempty` because the consumer stores it as `*int` and the wire-side `omitempty` had silently masked sub-millisecond cache hits (the producer truncated `time.Since().Milliseconds()` to 0 and the marshaller dropped the field). The producer now clamps real measurements to `≥1`; a `0` on the wire unambiguously means "not measured".
- `Identity` is a free-form JSONB object with a closed schema: `{vk, user, project, apiCredential, status}`. `status="matched"` when at least one of `user` / `project` resolved at request time; `status="pending"` when no owner could be attached, so the Hub `IdentityEnricher` background job picks the row up later via `DeviceAssignment.ip_address`.
- `EntityType` / `EntityID` / `EntityName` are top-level **denormalized** copies of the matched owner, dispatched by VK type so the indexed `entity_id` column carries a real foreign key (`NexusUser.id` for personal VKs, `Project.id` for application VKs, empty for unclassified callers). These power the per-user / per-project breakdown filters without a JSONB extract.
- `CacheStatus` carries the **unified rollup** (`HIT` | `MISS`) that filter UIs bind to. The four detail fields `GatewayCacheStatus`, `GatewayCacheSkipReason`, `GatewayCacheKind`, `ProviderCacheStatus` are drill-down only and feed the three audit-drawer layouts in `cost-estimation-architecture.md` §6.4. Derivation is centralized in `DeriveCacheStatus` so all stamping sites agree.
- `RequestBody` and `ResponseBody` are discriminated `audit.Body` containers (`{kind: absent|inline|spill, ...}`). The consumer demuxes onto `traffic_event_payload.inline_*_body` (JSONB) **or** `*_spill_ref` (JSONB pointer `{backend, key, size, sha256, contentType}`); exactly one is populated per direction, both `absent` means capture was off for that scope.
- `RequestNormalized` / `ResponseNormalized` ride as `json.RawMessage` so the wire stays schema-stable across normalize schema bumps. `NormalizeVersion` is stamped on the envelope when at least one direction was normalized.
- `PassthroughFlags` and `PassthroughReason` are populated only when an emergency-passthrough tier matched; absent fields keep the wire compact for the >99% of traffic where no bypass fired.
- `ThingID` / `ThingName` identify the emitting instance per source: originating agent device, gateway pod, or proxy pod.

`AdminAuditMessage` (admin-mutation envelope) lives in the same file but on a different queue (`nexus.event.admin-audit`); it is detailed in `admin-audit-log-coverage.md`.

## 7. Stream + queue topology

`EnsureStreams` creates two JetStream streams idempotently at Hub startup, both with `FileStorage` and `DiscardOld`:

- **`NEXUS_EVENTS`** — subject pattern `nexus.event.>`, `MaxAge = 6h`, `MaxBytes = 8 GiB`, `Retention = InterestPolicy`. Holds every audit envelope from every producer. InterestPolicy means messages stay on disk until **every** registered consumer group has acked, which is what enables the `hub-db-writer` + `hub-siem` fan-out: each group's progress is tracked independently and neither can mask the other's lag. The 6h `MaxAge` is the hard escape valve — with healthy drainage, events older than 6h are already persisted to `traffic_event`, so capping the stream at 6h means a wedged consumer auto-recovers faster once the wedge is fixed instead of pinning the stream past the rollover threshold.
- **`NEXUS_AUTH`** — subject pattern `nexus.auth.>`, `MaxAge = 24h`, `MaxBytes = 256 MiB`. Carries auth-plane coordination events (token revocation today). Not part of the audit pipeline.

Three subjects ride `NEXUS_EVENTS` for traffic events:

| Subject | Producer | `source` field on row |
|--|--|--|
| `nexus.event.ai-traffic` | ai-gateway (`audit.NewWriter`) | `ai-gateway` |
| `nexus.event.compliance` | compliance-proxy | `compliance-proxy` |
| `nexus.event.agent` | Hub (after HTTP upload from agent) | `agent` |

A fourth subject `nexus.event.admin-audit` rides the same stream for admin-mutation events; it is consumed by a different writer (see `admin-audit-log-coverage.md`).

## 8. Consumer side — `TrafficEventWriter`

`TrafficEventWriter` spawns one goroutine per queue under the consumer group `hub-db-writer`. Each goroutine wraps an MQ consume loop around a `BatchAccumulator[pendingTrafficMessage]` configured for `BatchSize = 100` and `FlushInterval = 5s` by default.

The per-message handler `handleMessage`:

1. Increments `nexus_mq_processed_total{queue}`.
2. JSON-unmarshals into the consumer-side `TrafficEventMessage`. **Deserialize failure → `Ack()` immediately and drop**, on the principle that a malformed message will fail forever and would otherwise block the consumer. The error is logged and `nexus_mq_traffic_errors_total{error_type="deserialize"}` increments — the log is the audit trail.
3. On successful unmarshal, calls `batch.Add(...)` and returns `mq.ErrDeferAck`, handing ack/nak responsibility to the batch-flush path. The batch flushes on size (100) **or** interval (5s), whichever comes first.

The `flush` path runs a single Postgres transaction per batch:

1. `pool.Begin(ctx)`. Failure → `nakOrDLQ`, `nexus_mq_batch_flush_total{result="error"}`, `nexus_mq_traffic_errors_total{error_type="db_begin"}`.
2. `insertTrafficEvents` — one `pgx.Batch` of parameterized INSERTs against `traffic_event` with `ON CONFLICT (id) DO NOTHING`. The wide INSERT covers the full column list; every text and JSON field is passed through `stripNul` / `stripNulPtr` / `stripNulJSON` first because providers like ChatGPT can include null bytes in SSE responses, and PostgreSQL UTF-8 columns reject `\x00` with `SQLSTATE 22021`. `compliance_tags` (a `NOT NULL` `text[]` column) is coerced to an empty slice when absent.
3. `insertPayloads` — same batch shape against `traffic_event_payload`. Demuxes the discriminated `Body` container onto either `inline_*_body` (the full marshalled `Body` envelope as JSONB, so non-JSON streaming SSE bytes can ride base64-encoded inside `inlineBytes`) **or** `*_spill_ref`. Skips events where both directions are `absent`.
4. `insertNormalizedPayloads` — same batch shape against `traffic_event_normalized`. **Failure here does NOT roll the batch** — raw bytes are already on `traffic_event_payload`, so a normalize-sidecar failure is logged + counted (`nexus_mq_traffic_errors_total{error_type="db_insert_normalized"}`) but the transaction proceeds.
5. `tx.Commit`. Failure → `nakOrDLQ`, error counters.
6. `ackAll`. Success counters fire.

Insert-side failure handling has one special case: `SQLSTATE 22021` (`invalid_character_value_for_cast`, the null-byte error). Because that is a permanent data error a retry will never fix, the batch is **acked** (not naked) with a warn-level log noting the poison batch. Every other DB error triggers `nakOrDLQ` (see §10.1).

## 9. Payload-capture cap

What lands on `traffic_event_payload` is bounded by `payloadcapture.Config`:

- `MaxRequestBytes` / `MaxResponseBytes` — network read caps. The gateway's `readBody` reads up to `MaxRequestBytes + 1` and returns `errRequestTooLarge` (→ HTTP 413) when the inbound body exceeds the cap. Defaults are 10 MiB each.
- `MaxInlineBodyBytes` — the **inline-vs-spill cutoff** the audit writer applies at flush time. Bodies whose captured size is `≤ MaxInlineBodyBytes` ride inline on `inline_*_body`; larger bodies are written to the spill backend via `spillstore.EmitBody` and the row keeps a `*_spill_ref`. Default 256 KiB.
- `StoreRequestBody` / `StoreResponseBody` — master capture flags, default `false`. When `false`, the producer never populates `Record.RequestBody` / `Record.ResponseBody` at all, so `traffic_event_payload` is not written for that row (both bodies are `absent`).

The config is a runtime snapshot store (`payloadcapture.Store`), wired into the audit Writer via `WithPayloadCaptureStore`. `recordToMessage` pulls the current threshold on **every** record, so admin-driven shadow updates take effect on the next flush without a service restart.

Bodies that hit the inline cap can still be truncated below the network cap when the producer captures a streaming response chunk-by-chunk; the `Truncated` flag on the `Body` envelope rides through onto `traffic_event_payload.request_truncated` / `response_truncated` so consumers know the persisted copy is not byte-complete.

## 10. Back-pressure, retry, and the consumer manager

Two consumer groups attach to the `NEXUS_EVENTS` stream:

- `hub-db-writer` (this doc) — three goroutines, one per traffic queue, batched insert.
- `hub-siem` (`siem-bridge-architecture.md`) — four goroutines, the three traffic queues plus `nexus.event.admin-audit`, configurable type filter, external sink.

The `consumer.Manager` orchestrates both groups (and the admin-audit writer) under a single lifecycle. It runs each consumer in its own goroutine, sets `nexus_consumer_healthy{consumer=<name>} = 1` on start and `0` on exit, captures per-consumer errors in a map, and exposes `HealthCheck()` for readiness probes.

Producer-side back-pressure:

- The in-memory buffer absorbs short bursts (10000 records).
- A sustained MQ outage drains the buffer to `maxQueueSize`, after which records are dropped and counted on `nexus_audit_mq_dropped_total`. The request itself is **never** blocked on audit.
- `Close()` retries draining for 15 seconds before counting the remainder as dropped, so a graceful rollout window cleanly flushes pending audit; a kill-9 path drops whatever is still in memory.

Consumer-side back-pressure:

- JetStream's `InterestPolicy` retains messages until every consumer group acks; a stalled `hub-db-writer` does not lose data — messages accumulate on disk up to `MaxBytes = 8 GiB` or `MaxAge = 6h`, whichever comes first.
- `DiscardOld` ensures a wedged consumer cannot push the stream into "insufficient_resources" publish errors — once the cap is hit, the oldest unacked messages are evicted so producers keep writing.
- DB-side errors split two ways: poison-pill (`22021`) is acked-and-skipped so the queue keeps flowing; every other error routes through `nakOrDLQ` (see §10.1 for the per-message redelivery cap + dead-letter queue).

### 10.1 Dead-letter queue

`nakOrDLQ` inspects each `mq.Message.NumDelivered` (populated from the NATS metadata at `packages/shared/transport/mq/consumer.go`) and routes each item independently:

- `NumDelivered < redeliveryThresholdAttempts` (default 5) → Nak. The broker redelivers per its policy.
- `NumDelivered ≥ redeliveryThresholdAttempts` → write the raw bytes to `traffic_event_dlq` (`tools/db-migrate/schema.prisma` model `traffic_event_dlq`: `msg_id`, `subject`, `payload`, `delivery_count`, `last_error`, `first_seen_at`, `dlq_inserted_at`) and Ack. The broker moves on; the operator inspects and decides whether to retry or discard.

If the DLQ insert itself fails the consumer falls back to Nak so the broker keeps trying — better to retry indefinitely than silently drop a message we don't have a record of.

Admin surface for inspection + retry:

- Hub: `GET /api/hub/dlq` (offset-paginated list, newest first, optional `subject` filter + `limit` / `offset`; returns `{rows,total}`) + `POST /api/hub/dlq/:id/retry` (republish + delete on success). Handler: `packages/nexus-hub/internal/fleet/handler/hubapi/hub_api_dlq.go`.
- Control Plane: `GET /api/admin/observability/dlq` + `POST /api/admin/observability/dlq/:id/retry`, proxying to Hub with JWT + IAM check + AdminAuditLog stamp. Handler: `packages/control-plane/internal/observability/dlq/handler/dlq.go`. IAM: `admin:observability-dlq.read` (list) / `admin:observability-dlq.manage` (retry).
- UI: `/infrastructure/dlq` page at `packages/control-plane-ui/src/pages/infrastructure/dlq/InfraDlqPage.tsx`.

Counter: `nexus_mq_dlq_inserted_total{subject}` records the DLQ insertion rate per MQ subject.

### 10.2 Normalize backfill

`insertNormalizedPayloads` partial failure (step 4 above) is logged but does NOT roll the transaction — raw bytes survive on `traffic_event_payload`, but the `traffic_event_normalized` sidecar is left missing or NULL. A periodic job heals these gaps:

- `packages/nexus-hub/internal/jobs/defs/audit/normalize_backfill.go` (default 5-minute interval) — LEFT-JOIN scan of `traffic_event` against `traffic_event_normalized`; for each missing-or-all-null sidecar row with inline bodies in `traffic_event_payload`, calls the injected `NormalizeRegistry.Normalize(...)` and upserts the sidecar. Wire-up at `packages/nexus-hub/cmd/nexus-hub/wiring/jobs.go` constructs the registry once via `shared/transport/normalize.BuildRegistry()` and passes it in.
- Spill-ref-only payloads skip until backend access is added.
- Counters: `nexus_normalize_backfill_scanned_total`, `nexus_normalize_backfill_filled_total`, `nexus_normalize_backfill_skipped_total{reason}`, `nexus_normalize_backfill_errors_total{phase}`.

## 11. Agent path is HTTP-then-MQ, not direct MQ

The agent is the only data-plane service that does not publish to MQ directly. Each enrolled host POSTs a batch of `AgentAuditEvent` records to `POST /api/internal/things/agent-audit` over its mTLS Thing channel. The Hub handler `UploadAgentAudit` parses the batch, performs identity stamping (the agent only knows its own Thing ID; the Hub resolves the enclosing `org` / `project` / `user` from the device assignment), envelopes each event into the same `TrafficEventMessage` shape, and publishes to `nexus.event.agent`. From that point the consumer path is identical to the other two sources.

The agent-specific shape differences (the agent measures upstream TTFB and total because it is a transparent forwarder; it does not have a routing rule; its `source` field is `agent`) are flattened into the same envelope columns. Cross-source stitching uses `TraceID` — the agent stamps the `X-Nexus-Request-Id` it sees on the upstream connection, the compliance proxy and gateway propagate it on their forward leg, and all three rows share the trace value at query time. See `otel-tracing-architecture.md` for the full chain.

## 12. Observability of the audit pipeline itself

Producer side (each data-plane service exposes these on its own `/metrics`):

| Metric | Labels | Meaning |
|--|--|--|
| `nexus_audit_mq_enqueue_total` | — | Records successfully handed to MQ producer |
| `nexus_audit_mq_enqueue_errors_total` | — | Producer.Enqueue failures (re-buffered or dropped) |
| `nexus_audit_mq_dropped_total` | — | Records dropped (queue full at enqueue time, or buffer full on re-buffer after a producer failure, or drained-past-deadline at shutdown) |

Consumer side (Hub `/metrics`):

| Metric | Labels | Meaning |
|--|--|--|
| `nexus_mq_processed_total` | `queue` | Messages received from each queue |
| `nexus_mq_batch_flush_total` | `result` (`success` \| `error`) | Per-batch DB commit outcome |
| `nexus_mq_batch_size` | — | Histogram of batch sizes at flush |
| `nexus_mq_traffic_errors_total` | `error_type` (`deserialize` \| `db_begin` \| `db_insert` \| `db_insert_payload` \| `db_insert_normalized` \| `db_commit` \| `dlq_insert`) | Per-failure-class breakdown |
| `nexus_mq_dlq_inserted_total` | `subject` | Messages moved to `traffic_event_dlq` after exhausting redelivery |
| `nexus_consumer_healthy` | `consumer` | 1 while the named consumer goroutine is running, 0 on exit |

Counter names carry the `nexus_` namespace because the Hub-side opsmetrics registry pins it at construction (`packages/shared/core/metrics/registry/registry.go`). Promoting one of these series requires only the namespaced name; the registered short form (`mq.processed_total`, etc.) is an implementation detail of the Go API.

The SIEM forwarder adds its own `nexus_siem_consumed_total{queue}`, `nexus_siem_sent_total{result}`, and `nexus_siem_errors_total{error_type}` — see `siem-bridge-architecture.md`.

The cardinality on `nexus_mq_processed_total{queue}` is exactly three (the traffic queues); pair it with `nexus_mq_traffic_errors_total{error_type="deserialize"}` to detect a producer-side schema bug, and with `nexus_consumer_healthy{consumer="traffic-event-writer"}` to detect a writer outage.

## 13. Failure modes and where they surface

| Symptom | Where it shows up | Recovery |
|--|--|--|
| Producer-side burst overload | `nexus_audit_mq_dropped_total` climbs on the source service | None — drops are accepted to preserve the request path; investigate the back-pressure source (MQ outage? consumer wedge?) |
| Sustained MQ outage | `nexus_audit_mq_enqueue_errors_total` climbs; eventually `nexus_audit_mq_dropped_total` rises | Restart NATS; flush will retry on next tick. `Close()` deadline drops whatever is in-memory at shutdown |
| Consumer wedge | `nexus_mq_processed_total{queue}` flat while producer counters rise; eventually JetStream `MaxAge` / `MaxBytes` discards messages | Investigate `nexus_consumer_healthy{consumer="traffic-event-writer"}`; restart Hub; backfilled rows are lost past the discard window |
| DB write failure (transient) | `nexus_mq_batch_flush_total{result="error"}` + `nexus_mq_traffic_errors_total{error_type=db_*}`; messages naked → redelivered (or DLQ after `redeliveryThresholdAttempts`) | Self-heals once the DB recovers; investigate `nexus_mq_dlq_inserted_total{subject}` for repeat offenders |
| DB write failure (poison-pill, null bytes) | `nexus_mq_batch_flush_total{result="error"}` once per affected batch; warn-level "permanent encoding error, acking to skip poison batch" log | None needed — the batch is dropped and the next batch proceeds. The producer-side `stripNul` plumbing prevents this almost everywhere; a leak is a producer-side bug |
| Normalize sidecar regression | `nexus_mq_traffic_errors_total{error_type="db_insert_normalized"}` climbs; raw rows still land on `traffic_event` and `traffic_event_payload`; the normalize-backfill job heals them on its next tick | Investigate `traffic_event_normalized` schema drift; `nexus_normalize_backfill_filled_total` confirms recovery |
