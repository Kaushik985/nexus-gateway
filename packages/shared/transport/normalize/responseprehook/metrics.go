// normalizePanicTotal counts panics recovered inside the response
// pre-hook callback. Two locations carry recover() guards (#97
// panic-safety): the Registry.Normalize call and the OnPayload
// caller-supplied stamp closure. The label `location` distinguishes
// them so admins can tell whether the bug is in normalize codecs or
// in the per-service audit-stamp closure.
//
// Without this counter the WARN log was the only signal — easy to
// miss in a busy log stream. #115/S1 architect review.
//
// Single shared registration covers all three data planes because
// every service routes its pre-hook through responseprehook.Build;
// Prometheus job/instance labels distinguish service in scrape
// output.

// prehookNormalizeDropTotal counts non-panic normalize failures —
// Registry.Normalize returned a non-nil error (ErrUnsupported or a
// tier hard-error), so the pre-hook callback dropped without
// stamping ci.Normalized. Downstream hook executors then see the
// flat-text fallback payload buildCheckpointInput produces, not the
// structured Normalized claim. PR #24 architect review S5: without
// this counter the silent-drop path is invisible — admins running
// Modify hooks on flat text would never know they're operating on
// degraded input.
//
// The label is the adapter id (lowercased — same key Registry uses
// for routing) so dashboards can surface "which provider's normalize
// is failing" without scraping logs.
