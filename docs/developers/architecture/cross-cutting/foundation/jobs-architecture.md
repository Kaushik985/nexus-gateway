# Jobs Architecture

Hub runs all of Nexus's periodic housekeeping in a **single in-process scheduler** built on `github.com/robfig/cron/v3`. There is no Sidekiq, no Celery, no Kubernetes `CronJob` resource, and no Postgres-based work queue. The 45 jobs documented in §5 are registered once at Hub boot, run inside the Hub process, and persist their definitions + run history to two Postgres tables (`job`, `job_run`) so the admin UI can show "last run / next run / 7-day run history" without scraping logs.

Anchor packages:

- `packages/nexus-hub/internal/jobs/scheduler/scheduler.go` — `*Scheduler`, the cron driver
- `packages/nexus-hub/internal/jobs/store/jobstore.go` — `*jobstore.Store`, the persistence layer for the `job` and `job_run` tables
- `packages/nexus-hub/internal/jobs/defs/` — 9 sub-domain packages, one Go file per job
- `packages/nexus-hub/internal/alerts/eval/engine.go` — the streaming alert engine, registered as one more `scheduler.Job`
- `packages/nexus-hub/cmd/nexus-hub/wiring/jobs.go` — `InitScheduler` builds every job and calls `sched.Register(...)`

## 1. What this doc covers

The scheduler is **scheduled work only**: jobs whose Run method is triggered by a cron tick (or a manual admin click), with the scheduler itself responsible for timeout, panic recovery, and run-history persistence. Three nearby things are out of scope:

- **MQ consumers** (`hub-db-writer`, `hub-siem`, `hub-alerting`) run as long-lived goroutines under the `consumer.Manager` in the same Hub binary — see `mq-architecture.md`.
- **Per-request work** in the data-plane services (AI Gateway, Compliance Proxy, Agent) — those services have no scheduler; their periodic work (cache TTLs, metric flushes) is owned by the relevant code path's own ticker.
- **External cron** like `prod-deploy` scripts or k8s `CronJob`s — Nexus has none in production.

## 2. Scheduler core architecture

### One cron engine, no advisory locks

`scheduler.Start` constructs a single `cron.Cron` with two wrappers applied to every registered entry:

- `cron.SkipIfStillRunning(logAdapter)` — if a previous tick of the same job is still running when the next tick fires, the new tick is dropped (logged at INFO). This is what keeps a long `data-retention` sweep from stacking onto itself when it overruns the 24-hour interval.
- `cron.Recover(logAdapter)` — a panic inside a job is logged at ERROR and does not bring the cron engine down.

The scheduler **holds zero pgxpool connections of its own**. An earlier design used per-job advisory locks (one DB conn per job for the lifetime of each Run); that caused a self-deadlock at boot because concurrent jobs each held a conn for their lock plus needed additional conns for their actual work, and the pool was sized for the work, not the locks. The current scheduler delegates concurrency control to the job itself (either idempotent SQL, watermarks in `system_metadata`, or per-row Postgres row locks taken during the job's own transactions).

### `cfg.Scheduler.Enabled` is the leader switch

There is no runtime leader election. Multi-Hub deployments designate a single Hub as the scheduler leader by setting `cfg.Scheduler.Enabled: true` on exactly one replica; the others set it to `false` and `InitScheduler` returns `nil` early. At today's deployment scale (single-region, two-Hub HA pair where one is hot, one is warm), this is the right complexity boundary — adding etcd/Raft leader election would be infrastructure cost with no observed benefit.

The leader writes its `cfg.Hub.ID` into the `replica_id` column of every `job_run` row, so the admin UI can show which instance executed which run. When the leader fails over, the new leader inherits the `job` table state but `RecoverStaleRuns` (§3) cleans up orphan rows from the previous leader.

### 1-second interval floor

`robfig/cron/v3`'s `@every` parser silently clamps sub-second intervals to 1 second. Every Nexus job today has Interval ≥ 5 seconds (the fastest are `semantic-cache-reindex` and `alerteval-engine` at 5 s; the next tier is `stale-thing-sweep` + `credential-circuit-flush` at 30 s), so this floor never matters in practice. Job authors needing sub-second granularity should pick a different mechanism — cron is for housekeeping, not control-loop tight cycles.

## 3. Job lifecycle

### The `Job` interface

```go
type Job interface {
    ID() string
    Name() string
    Description() string
    Interval() time.Duration
    Run(ctx context.Context) error
}
```

`ID` is the stable slug used as the primary key in the `job` table — renaming it breaks the admin UI's history continuity, so renames are migration-grade changes. `Name` and `Description` are human-readable; `Description` should fit in one sentence (the admin UI renders it inline).

Two optional capabilities are detected by type assertion:

- `OnStartRunner` — `RunOnStart() bool` returning true makes the scheduler execute the job once immediately after `Start`, before the first tick. Used by long-interval jobs (5 m / 1 h / daily rollups) so the first pass is not delayed for the full interval after boot. About a third of the jobs implement this.
- `MaxRunDurationer` — `MaxRunDuration() time.Duration` overrides the default per-run timeout (default is `max(Interval, 60s)`). Used by long-running sweeps (monthly retention over large tables) whose Run legitimately exceeds the interval-derived default.

### Boot sequence

`InitScheduler` runs four steps in order, and each must finish before the next starts:

1. `New(logger).WithJobStore(jobStore).WithReplicaID(hubID)` — wire dependencies. No I/O yet.
2. `sched.Register(...)` × N (46 calls) — populate the in-memory `jobs map[string]*entry`. Each entry defaults to enabled; the persisted `enabled` flag from `job.enabled` will overwrite this in step 3.
3. `sched.SyncDefinitions(ctx)` — for every registered job, upsert `(id, name, description, interval_sec)` into the `job` table, then read back `enabled` and reconcile the in-memory atomic. **`SyncDefinitions` does not touch the `enabled` column on upsert** — admin disables survive Hub restarts, code changes to name/description/interval propagate.
4. `sched.RecoverStaleRuns(ctx)` — flip every `job_run` row still in `status='running'` to `'interrupted'`. These are orphans from the previous Hub process that died mid-Run; without this step the admin UI would show them as perpetually running.
5. `sched.Start()` — construct the cron engine, register every enabled entry via `cron.AddFunc("@every <interval>", runOne)`, start the engine, then kick off every `OnStartRunner.RunOnStart()=true` entry in a detached goroutine so `Start` returns promptly.

### `SetEnabled` is hot

Admin can toggle a job from the UI without restarting Hub. `SetEnabled(ctx, id, true)` writes `enabled=true` to the `job` table, flips the in-memory atomic, and **immediately adds the entry to the running cron engine** via `cron.AddFunc`. Disable removes the entry. The DB write happens first; if it fails, the in-memory state is not touched and the live cron is not modified — the admin gets the error and tries again.

### `Trigger` is manual + bypasses enabled

`Trigger(ctx, id)` runs a job once immediately in a detached goroutine, **bypassing the enabled flag** (so an admin can manually invoke a disabled job for one-off forensics). The run still goes through the same `runOne` path that records to `job_run` and respects the per-job timeout. The caller's ctx is intentionally *not* propagated into the Run — the manual trigger survives the admin HTTP request completing before the job finishes. Only scheduler `Stop` (or process death) terminates the in-flight run.

## 4. JobStore + run history

Two tables back the scheduler: `job` (one row per registered job, mutable enabled flag) and `job_run` (one row per Run invocation, append-only history).

### `job` table contract

- `id` (PK) — matches `Job.ID()`
- `name`, `description`, `interval_sec` — overwritten by every `SyncDefinitions` call; code changes propagate
- `enabled` — admin-controlled, **never** overwritten by `SyncDefinitions`. Defaults to true for newly-registered jobs (the first `SyncDefinitions` after registration inserts the row with `enabled=true`); subsequent `SyncDefinitions` calls leave the column alone.

### `job_run` table contract

- `id` (PK, ULID) — assigned by `StartRun` and returned to the scheduler so `FinishRun` can update the same row
- `job_id` (FK to `job.id`)
- `replica_id` — set from `WithReplicaID(hubID)` so the admin UI shows which Hub instance executed the run
- `started_at`, `finished_at`, `duration_ms`
- `status` — `running` | `success` | `error` | `interrupted` (the last set by `RecoverStaleRuns` for orphans)
- `error_message` — empty on success; populated on `error` / DB-stored stack on panic

### `FinishRun` uses a detached ctx

The Run's ctx has a hard deadline (§6). If a Run hits `context.DeadlineExceeded`, its own ctx is dead — but the scheduler still needs to record `status='error'` + `error_message='context deadline exceeded'` so the admin UI shows the failure. The scheduler uses `context.Background()` for the `FinishRun` call to escape the dead ctx:

```go
if ferr := s.js.FinishRun(context.Background(), runID, status, dur, errMsg); ferr != nil {
    ...
}
```

A deadline-exceeded run that *also* fails to record its FinishRun row (DB outage at the same moment) shows up in the next boot's `RecoverStaleRuns` sweep as `interrupted`. This is the worst-case path and is observable.

## 5. Job catalogue

The 46 rows below are the complete production catalogue. Every row is anchored to a `Register()` call in `cmd/nexus-hub/wiring/jobs.go` (or `registerAlertEvalEngine` for `alerteval-engine`). Default cadences come from the job constructor's `interval` default; admins override via the corresponding `cfg.Scheduler.Intervals.*` field (and `cfg.Scheduler.Retention.*` for retention windows). Some constructors take cadence directly from `cfg.Scheduler.*Interval` with no zero-default — those rows show `(cfg)` and are documented in the operator config doc.

The 8 multi-cadence variants (rows whose file column says "cadence variant") are constructed at runtime from helper structs (`rollup_merge.go`, `thing_rollup_merge.go`, `ops_rollup_cascade.go`) rather than having one `JobID` const each. These IDs are the only ones the `scripts/check-jobs-catalogue.sh` pre-commit gate machine-verifies; the rest are honor-system but every static `JobID` const present in the tree must appear below.

### 5.1 Traffic + ops rollup pipeline (13 jobs)

The 5-minute → 1-hour → 1-day → 1-month rollup cascade for both fleet-wide traffic metrics and per-Thing traffic metrics, plus the parallel ops-metrics cascade.

| ID | File | Default cadence | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `rollup-5m` | `defs/rollup/rollup_5m.go` | 1 min | Aggregates `traffic_event` rows into `metric_rollup_5m` every minute, catching up from the last committed bucket to the most recent sealed 5-minute bucket. |
| `merge-1h` | `defs/rollup/rollup_merge.go` (cadence variant) | 5 min | Merges `metric_rollup_5m` into `metric_rollup_1h`, catching up from the persisted watermark to the most recent sealed 1-hour bucket. |
| `merge-1d` | `defs/rollup/rollup_merge.go` (cadence variant) | 1 hour | Merges `metric_rollup_1h` into `metric_rollup_1d`, catching up to the most recent sealed 1-day bucket. |
| `merge-1mo` | `defs/rollup/rollup_merge.go` (cadence variant) | 24 hour | Merges `metric_rollup_1d` into `metric_rollup_1mo` using calendar-month bucket boundaries. |
| `thing-rollup-5m` | `defs/rollup/thing_rollup_5m.go` | 1 min | Per-Thing variant of `rollup-5m`: aggregates `traffic_event` rows with `thing_id` into `thing_metric_rollup_5m`, keyed by (thing_id, metric, dim, sub-dim). |
| `thing-merge-1h` | `defs/rollup/thing_rollup_merge.go` (cadence variant) | 5 min | Per-Thing variant of `merge-1h`. |
| `thing-merge-1d` | `defs/rollup/thing_rollup_merge.go` (cadence variant) | 1 hour | Per-Thing variant of `merge-1d`. |
| `thing-merge-1mo` | `defs/rollup/thing_rollup_merge.go` (cadence variant) | 24 hour | Per-Thing variant of `merge-1mo` (calendar-month boundaries). |
| `rollup-correction` | `defs/rollup/rollup_correction.go` | 24 hour | Recomputes rollups for T-1 (yesterday) to absorb late-arriving events. Re-runs every 5-minute bucket then re-merges the 1h, 1d, and (on month boundary) 1mo layers. |
| `metrics-rollup` | `defs/metrics/metrics_rollup.go` | 1 hour | Aggregates device fleet status/OS and agent action volume into `metric_rollup_1h`. |
| `ops-rollup-1h` | `defs/metrics/ops_rollup_1h.go` | 5 min | Aggregates `metric_ops_raw` into `metric_ops_rollup_1h`. Services keep per-instance rows; agents collapse into a single fleet-aggregate row (`thing_id IS NULL`) per metric+dim unless in diagnostic mode for the bucket. |
| `ops-rollup-1d` | `defs/metrics/ops_rollup_cascade.go` (cadence variant) | 1 hour | Aggregates `metric_ops_rollup_1h` into `metric_ops_rollup_1d`. Sample-count-weighted averages; histograms merge element-wise. Preserves the fleet vs per-thing distinction from the 1h layer. |
| `ops-rollup-1mo` | `defs/metrics/ops_rollup_cascade.go` (cadence variant) | 24 hour | Aggregates `metric_ops_rollup_1d` into `metric_ops_rollup_1mo` once per day, calendar-month boundaries; current (unsealed) month always excluded. |

### 5.2 Health + reliability rollup (2 jobs)

Per-credential and per-provider health rollups feeding the `credential.*` and `provider.unavailable` alert families.

| ID | File | Default cadence | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `credential-health-rollup` | `defs/rollup/credential_health_rollup.go` | 5 min | Computes per-credential health (healthy / degraded / unavailable / collecting / unknown), dominantError, and trend (improving / stable / degrading) from `traffic_event` over a short (5 min) and long (1 h) window. Persists to `Credential.health*` columns; only rows whose status changed update `healthStatusChangedAt`. |
| `provider-health-rollup` | `defs/rollup/provider_health_rollup.go` | 5 min | Recomputes `ProviderHealth` (error rate, avg latency, sample count, status) from `traffic_event` over a 30-minute rolling window. Replaces the AI Gateway in-process HealthTracker DB flush. |

### 5.3 Retention + flush (6 jobs)

Periodic purge and Redis-to-DB drain jobs.

| ID | File | Default cadence | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `data-retention` | `defs/retention/data_retention.go` | 24 hour | Deletes audit and rollup rows older than the configured retention period (`cfg.Scheduler.Retention.{TrafficEventDays, TrafficEventPayloadDays, AdminAuditLogDays, MetricRollupDays}`). |
| `ops-retention` | `defs/retention/ops_retention.go` | 24 hour | Chunked-DELETEs aged `metric_ops_rollup_5m/1h/1d/1mo` and `thing_diag_event` rows. Per-class retention is read live from `metric_ops_retention_config` (one row per layer: runtime_5m, business_5m, runtime/business_1h, runtime/business_1d, runtime/business_1mo, diag_info, diag_warn, diag_error, diag_fatal). Does NOT touch `metric_ops_raw` — that is partition-dropped by `ops-raw-partition`. Deletes run in chunks of 10k rows so transactions stay short. |
| `ops-raw-partition` | `defs/retention/ops_raw_partition.go` | 6 hour | Maintains the daily RANGE partitions of `metric_ops_raw`: pre-creates upcoming day partitions and DROPs partitions older than `NEXUS_HUB_SCHEDULER_OPS_RAW_DAYS` (default 30). Replaces row-by-row DELETE of raw with O(1) whole-day partition drops. |
| `rollup-retention` | `defs/rollup/rollup_retention.go` | 24 hour | Purges aged rows from `metric_rollup_5m/1h/1d/1mo` based on per-tier retention days (`cfg.Scheduler.Retention.Rollup{5m,1h,1d,1mo}Days`). |
| `job-retention` | `defs/retention/job_retention.go` | 24 hour | Prunes `job_run` rows, keeping the N most recent runs per job (default N=100). |
| `credential-stats-flush` | `defs/retention/credential_stats_flush.go` | 60 sec | Drains per-credential usage counters and timestamps from Redis into the `Credential` table. Runs frequently to keep `lastUsedAt`, `lastSuccessAt`, `lastFailureAt`, and `totalUsageCount` up to date without high-frequency concurrent DB writes. |
| `credential-circuit-flush` | `defs/retention/credential_circuit_flush.go` | 30 sec | Drains `cred:circuit:dirty` Redis set into `Credential.circuit*` columns. Uses an in-flight working set for at-least-once delivery; rehydrates Redis from DB on first run after restart. |

### 5.4 State-poll alerts (6 jobs)

Class-1 alert jobs (in the alerting taxonomy): poll DB state every interval and raise/resolve alerts based on the snapshot. Distinct from `alerteval-engine` (§5.9), which is class-4 streaming over MQ.

| ID | File | Default cadence | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `thing-offline-alerts` | `defs/health/thing_offline_alerts.go` | 60 sec | Raises `thing.offline` for Things whose `last_seen_at` has exceeded the rule's `offlineAfterSec` threshold; auto-resolves firing alerts for Things that have come back fresh or have been deleted. |
| `provider-unavailable-alerts` | `defs/health/provider_unavailable_alerts.go` | 60 sec | Raises `provider.unavailable` for Providers whose `ProviderHealth.status` is `unavailable`; auto-resolves when the provider recovers to healthy, recovering, or degraded. |
| `credential-reliability-alerts` | `defs/health/credential_reliability_alerts.go` | 60 sec | Raises `credential.circuit_open`, `credential.health_unavailable`, and `credential.health_degraded_sustained` alerts from the persisted reliability state on the `Credential` table. |
| `credential-stale-alerts` | `defs/health/credential_stale_alerts.go` | 1 hour | Polls `Credential.lastSuccessAt` for enabled credentials and raises `credential.stale_last_success` when no successful use in `params.staleAfterDays`; auto-resolves once a credential is used successfully again. |
| `agent-cert-expiration-alerts` | `defs/health/agent_cert_expiration_alerts.go` | 1 hour | Polls `thing_agent.cert_expires_at` for desktop-agent Things and raises `agent.cert_expiration_imminent` as each warn-day threshold (default 30 / 14 / 7 / 1 days) approaches. Auto-resolves on renewal. |
| `cache-quality-monitor` | `defs/health/cache_quality_monitor.go` | 5 min | Detects elevated error rates in normaliser-modified requests over the past 30 minutes and auto-reverts all active rules to `dry_run_always` when the error rate exceeds 3× baseline, preventing normaliser-induced quality regressions. |

### 5.5 Expiry + auto-revert (7 jobs)

Time-based state transitions: an admin set a window, the window has passed, the scheduler flips the flag.

| ID | File | Default cadence | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `auth-cleanup` | `defs/expiry/auth_cleanup.go` | 1 hour | Deletes expired refresh and revoked token rows. |
| `enrollment-cleanup` | `defs/expiry/enrollment_cleanup.go` | 1 hour | Marks expired pending agent enrollment tokens as `expired`. |
| `vk-expiry` | `defs/expiry/vk_expiry.go` | 1 hour | Expires virtual keys past their expiry date and raises `quota.vk_expiring` alerts for keys expiring within the warn window. Auto-resolves on renewal or once outside the window. |
| `credential-expiry` | `defs/expiry/credential_expiry.go` | 1 hour | Advances `rotationState` to `pending_rotation` and raises `credential.expiring` alerts for credentials approaching `expiresAt`. Raises CRITICAL alerts for overdue credentials (no auto-disable). Auto-resolves once a credential is no longer in the expiring set. |
| `credential-retire` | `defs/expiry/credential_retire.go` | 1 hour | Advances credentials from `retiring` → `retired` (after drain window) and hard-deletes retired credentials past their `retireAt` date. |
| `override-expiry` | `defs/expiry/override_expiry.go` | (cfg, RunOnStart) | Clears `thing_config_override` rows past their `expires_at` — including the per-thing `diag_mode` override that carries a diagnostic-mode window (`expires_at` = window end), so an expired window stops raising the agent's log level without a dedicated job. |
| `passthrough.expiry` | `defs/expiry/passthrough_expiry.go` | 60 sec | Flips `enabled=false` on emergency-passthrough rows whose `expires_at` has passed across global / adapter / provider tiers. |

### 5.6 Drift + housekeeping (5 jobs)

Reconciliation jobs that compare desired state vs reported state vs actual state.

| ID | File | Default cadence | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `config-drift-check` | `defs/drift/drift.go` | (cfg) | Detects Things whose reported config version differs from desired and triggers repair via the fleet manager. |
| `stale-thing-sweep` | `defs/drift/stale_thing.go` | 30 sec | Marks Things offline when their `last_seen_at` exceeds the per-category threshold (default 60 s for service Things). |
| `smart-group-recompute` | `defs/drift/smart_group_recompute.go` | 60 sec | Re-evaluates every smart `DeviceGroup`'s `membership_query` against the current device fleet and replaces the `device_group_membership_cache` rows. Runs every 60 s as a safety net; heartbeat-driven recomputes handle the steady-state. |
| `user-identity-enrichment` | `defs/drift/identity_enrichment.go` | (cfg) | Backfills user identity fields into recent `traffic_event` rows using IAM lookups. |
| `exemption-gc` | `defs/drift/exemption_gc.go` | 5 min | Fires a Cat B invalidate signal when compliance exemption grants have recently expired so compliance-proxy refreshes its in-memory view without waiting for the next admin mutation. |

### 5.7 Audit (3 jobs)

Integrity + observability of the admin audit pipeline.

| ID | File | Default cadence | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `audit-chain-verify` | `defs/audit/audit_chain_verify.go` | (cfg, RunOnStart) | Walks the `AdminAuditLog` hash chain (`previousHash` / `integrityHash`) and reports tamper detection at ERROR level. |
| `audit-freshness-check` | `defs/audit/audit_freshness_check.go` | 60 sec | Alarms when the most recent admin audit row is older than 5 min — catches the silent-stall failure class where the MQ consumer pulled the message but the INSERT failed. |
| `siem-bridge` | `defs/audit/siem_bridge.go` | `bridge.PollInterval()` | Polls `traffic_event` and `AdminAuditLog` for new rows, classifies them, and forwards them to the configured SIEM sink. Checkpoints persisted in `system_metadata`. Registered only when `cfg.Consumers.SIEM.Enabled`. |

### 5.8 Quota (1 job)

| ID | File | Default cadence | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `quota-alert-check` | `defs/quota/quota_alert_check.go` | 60 sec | Evaluates current-month cost usage against `QuotaOverride` and `QuotaPolicy` cost limits every minute and raises `quota.threshold` alerts when usage crosses configured thresholds. Auto-resolves with 2 percentage-point hysteresis once usage falls back. |

### 5.9 Cache infrastructure (1 job)

| ID | File | Default cadence | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `semantic-cache-reindex` | `defs/semanticcacheflush/job.go` | 5 sec | Blue/green Valkey vector index swap when the embedding model fingerprint changes. Creates the new FT index, drops the old one, and stamps an audit row. No-op when fingerprints already match. |

### 5.10 Streaming alert engine (1 job, registered as a scheduler.Job)

| ID | File | Default cadence | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `alerteval-engine` | `alerts/eval/engine.go` | 5 sec (TickSec) | Subscribes to MQ traffic + audit events under the `hub-alerting` consumer group, maintains in-memory ring buffers per registered Aggregator, and evaluates threshold rules every tick. Lives outside `internal/jobs/defs/` but implements `scheduler.Job` so its status appears alongside the others in the admin UI. |

### Catalogue totals

| Sub-domain | Count |
|---|---|
| 5.1 Traffic + ops rollup | 13 |
| 5.2 Health rollup | 2 |
| 5.3 Retention + flush | 6 |
| 5.4 State-poll alerts | 6 |
| 5.5 Expiry + auto-revert | 7 |
| 5.6 Drift + housekeeping | 5 |
| 5.7 Audit | 3 |
| 5.8 Quota | 1 |
| 5.9 Cache infrastructure | 1 |
| 5.10 Streaming alert engine | 1 |
| **Total** | **46** |

These 46 rows correspond 1-to-1 with the `Register()` / `registerAlertEvalEngine()` calls in `packages/nexus-hub/cmd/nexus-hub/wiring/jobs.go`. The `siem-bridge` row is registered conditionally on `cfg.Consumers.SIEM.Enabled`; every other row is registered unconditionally whenever `cfg.Scheduler.Enabled` is true.

## 6. Failure semantics

### Per-run hard timeout

`runOne` wraps every Run in `context.WithTimeout`. The timeout is:

- `MaxRunDuration()` if the job implements `MaxRunDurationer`, else
- `max(Interval, 60s)` — at least 60 s so a 5-second-interval job still has a generous cap; otherwise `Interval` so the next tick is never blocked by an overrunning Run.

A `context.DeadlineExceeded` failure is logged at WARN level (with `job`, `duration`, and `max` keys) — this is "expected" timeout, treated differently from "the job genuinely errored". Any other error is logged at ERROR. Both still write `status='error'` + the error message to `job_run`.

### Panic recovery

Panics inside a tick-triggered Run are caught by `cron.Recover(logAdapter)` registered in the wrapper chain at `Start`. Panics inside a `Trigger`-triggered (manual) Run are caught by a `defer recover()` directly in `runOne` because the manual path bypasses the cron wrapper chain. Either way, the panic is logged at ERROR with `job` + `panic` keys and the scheduler keeps running.

### Skip-if-still-running

`cron.SkipIfStillRunning(logAdapter)` is applied to every entry. If a previous tick's Run is still executing when the next tick fires, the new tick is dropped and logged at INFO. This is what keeps a long `data-retention` sweep from stacking onto itself when row counts spike — the next 24-hour tick will simply skip until the previous one finishes. Job authors should size their work to complete within the interval; persistent skipping is a signal to either raise the interval or shard the work.

### Graceful stop

`Stop` signals the cron engine to stop accepting new ticks, then waits up to `stopDrainTimeout` (30 s) for in-flight Runs to finish, then cancels the scheduler-wide ctx. A Run still executing past the drain timeout gets its ctx cancelled — well-behaved jobs check ctx and return; ill-behaved jobs may leave their Run goroutine alive until the process exits. `Stop` is idempotent; a second call is a no-op.

## 7. Admin UI / introspection

The admin UI's Infrastructure → Jobs page reads from the scheduler via the Hub HTTP API:

- `ListJobs(ctx)` — returns `[]JobStatus` for all registered jobs. When a jobstore is attached, the aggregate counters (`RunCount`, `ErrorCount`), `LastRun`, `LastDuration`, `LastStatus`, `LastError` come from `ListJobsWithStats` so values reflect history across restarts. `NextRun` is sourced live from the cron engine when the job is currently scheduled (entry registered, not disabled); falls back to a `LastRun + Interval` estimate when the engine has stopped or the job is disabled.
- `GetJob(ctx, id)` — same shape, single job.
- `SetEnabled(ctx, id, enabled)` — toggle. DB write first; in-memory atomic + live cron entry add/remove only on DB success.
- `Trigger(ctx, id)` — manual run, bypassing enabled, in a detached goroutine. Returns immediately; the caller polls `ListRuns` to see the result.
- `ListRuns(ctx, id, limit, offset)` — paginated `job_run` history newest-first, plus a total count for paginator UI.

`statusFromStats` is the function that joins the persisted aggregate row with the live cron entry to produce a `JobStatus` — read this when wondering why a `NextRun` value on the UI looks stale (most common cause: the job is disabled, so there's no live cron entry, and the value is the `LastRun + Interval` estimate).

## 8. Operations

### Designating the scheduler leader

Set `cfg.Scheduler.Enabled: true` on **exactly one** Hub replica in a multi-Hub deployment. On every other replica set it to `false`. `InitScheduler` returns `nil` early when disabled, so other Hub functions (HTTP API, MQ consumers, fleet manager) keep running normally — only the scheduler is gated.

Two leaders simultaneously enabled is a misconfiguration: both will try to advance the same `job_run` rows, both will try to acquire row-level locks on `traffic_event` during rollup, and you will see duplicate runs in the admin UI plus elevated DB CPU. There is no detection or auto-correction — the operator must reconcile config.

### Tuning per-job cadence

Most cadences are driven by the constructor's `interval` default but can be overridden via `cfg.Scheduler.Intervals.*` fields (see `packages/nexus-hub/internal/config/config.go` for the canonical struct). The `(cfg)` annotation in §5 marks jobs whose constructor has no default and reads the interval verbatim from the config struct.

Retention windows are separate from cadence: `cfg.Scheduler.Retention.{TrafficEventDays, AdminAuditLogDays, MetricRollupDays, Rollup5mDays, Rollup1hDays, Rollup1dDays, Rollup1moDays, TrafficEventPayloadDays}` control *how much data each retention sweep deletes*, not how often the sweep runs. Per-class ops retention (the rich set in `ops-retention`) lives in the `metric_ops_retention_config` table and is editable at runtime without a Hub restart.

### Adding a new job

Four steps:

1. **Code** — create `packages/nexus-hub/internal/jobs/defs/<sub-domain>/<name>.go` with a struct that implements `scheduler.Job`. Define a `<name>JobID = "<slug>"` const at top-of-file (the lockstep script's grep pattern is `[a-zA-Z]+JobID\s*=`). If the cadence should be admin-tunable, accept it from a config field; if it has a sensible default, fall back to that default in the constructor.
2. **Wire** — add a `sched.Register(...)` call in the appropriate clause of `InitScheduler` in `packages/nexus-hub/cmd/nexus-hub/wiring/jobs.go`. Pick the right arguments — most jobs take `pool` (pgxpool), some take `raiser` (for alert-raising jobs), some take `alertStore` (for jobs that need rule params).
3. **Catalogue** — add a row to the right §5 sub-section of this doc. The pre-commit `check-jobs-catalogue.sh` script's strict enforcement only covers the 8 multi-cadence variants today, but the convention is that every static `JobID` const must appear in §5. If you skip this and the strict scan ever turns on, the gate will fail.
4. **Config** — if the cadence is admin-tunable, add a field to `cfg.Scheduler.Intervals` and document it in the operator config doc.

### The lockstep gate's current scope

`scripts/check-jobs-catalogue.sh` machine-enforces two things:

1. The 8 multi-cadence variant IDs (`merge-1h`, `merge-1d`, `merge-1mo`, `thing-merge-1h`, `thing-merge-1d`, `thing-merge-1mo`, `ops-rollup-1d`, `ops-rollup-1mo`) must each appear in this doc.
2. (Currently inactive) A glob loop intended to scan every `*.go` file under `packages/nexus-hub/internal/jobs/` for `<name>JobID = "..."` consts and verify each appears in this doc. The glob is `"$JOBS_DIR"/*.go`, which only matches top-level files; the jobs live in `defs/<sub-domain>/`, so the loop currently iterates over nothing. This is a known gap — the §5 catalogue is the convention-enforced source of truth until the glob is fixed (recursive `find` would be the trivial fix).

The lockstep is skipped entirely when this doc is absent (escape hatch added during the 2026-05-22 archive sweep). The escape hatch is documented at the top of the script; removing it re-enables strict mode.

### Reading runs during incidents

The admin UI's Infrastructure → Jobs page is the primary surface. For shell-side investigation:

```sql
-- last 20 runs of a job, newest first
SELECT id, started_at, finished_at, duration_ms, status, error_message
FROM job_run
WHERE job_id = 'rollup-5m'
ORDER BY started_at DESC
LIMIT 20;

-- jobs with the most errors in the last 24 h
SELECT job_id, COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE status = 'error') AS errs, COUNT(*) AS total
FROM job_run
WHERE started_at > now() - interval '24 hours'
GROUP BY job_id
ORDER BY errs DESC;

-- orphan rows that should have been cleaned by RecoverStaleRuns
-- (a non-empty result is a bug — file an issue)
SELECT * FROM job_run WHERE status = 'running' AND started_at < now() - interval '2 hours';
```

A `status='error'` run's `error_message` is the formatted output of `err.Error()` from the Run; pair it with the Hub's `slog` ERROR line at the same timestamp for full context (stack trace, job-specific structured fields).
