// recent events, policy rules, runtime snapshots, config summary,
// shutdown warning, …). The menu bar only reads two fields:
// `state` (for the tray icon tint) and `agent.deviceID` (to decide
// whether the daemon is in pending-enrollment mode). Everything
// else is decoded permissively — extra keys on the wire are
// ignored — so the daemon can continue evolving its snapshot
// shape without breaking the menu.
