# Maintainers

This file is the canonical list of people with merge authority and the areas they own. It is the single source of truth for maintainer status. The [`docs/_wiki/Community-Maintainers.md`](docs/_wiki/Community-Maintainers.md) page mirrors this list and is kept in sync at release cadence.

## Project lead

**Project Maintainer** `<maintainers@example.com>` — project lead, all areas.

Holds final decision authority on architecture boundaries, API contracts, data models, binding workflow rules (`CLAUDE.md`, `.cursor/rules/`), release timing, and changes to cross-cutting contracts (IAM policy shapes, config key catalog, service topology).

## How to become a maintainer

Nexus Gateway uses a project-lead governance model. A single project lead makes final decisions on architecture, scope, and release timing, with input from maintainers and the broader community.

The path to maintainer status is through sustained, high-quality contribution to a specific area: participating in code reviews, following the mandatory development workflow (Plan → SDD → OpenAPI → Code → Tests), keeping documentation in lockstep with code changes, and demonstrating familiarity with the binding rules in `CLAUDE.md`. There is no minimum commit count; quality and consistency matter more than volume.

When a contributor has established ownership of an area — meaning they are the person others naturally turn to for review on that surface — an existing maintainer may nominate them. Nominations are discussed openly in GitHub Discussions. The project lead approves all additions and removals. Any change to this file is made via pull request.
